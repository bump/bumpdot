			 <p>There are very few things in the computer world that would immediately get me to sit down at my computer, log into my CMS, and post something to this blog. One of these things, however, is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/12/that-stupid-apple-notes-a">a post about the &ldquo;a&rdquo; glyph in Apple Notes</a>.</p>
<p>Let me just start by saying that Apple Notes is overall just an amazing tool for a free included app. It works great, it syncs well, and I use it like a virtual filing cabinet. If it&rsquo;s not in Noteplan, it&rsquo;s probably in Notes.</p>
<p>Having said that, both the Daring Fireball post on this, and the Engadget post it refers back to, are spot on. It&rsquo;s an odd decision that Apple seems strangely committed to.</p>

			 <p>An understatement to say that a lot has happened since my last post. Be kind to yourself and others.</p>
<p>I just returned home from Hawaii, my second work trip of the year already, and I leave on another one on Monday. I don&rsquo;t seem to managing the jet lag well this time. I was in Hawaii for a whole week, and still haven&rsquo;t recovered from the red eye I flew home.</p>
<p>A couple of things I have been enjoying.</p>
<p>Last year, I purchased a <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/ivy-2-mini-photo-printer">Canon Ivy 2 printer</a>. It&rsquo;s a small printer that connects to your phone, and prints on sticker paper. I have been adding a picture to a <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/hon/">Hobobichi Hon</a> every day this year so far, and have really been enjoying the process, as well as the results. The prints are a little dark, the quality isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it&rsquo;s fun to pick an image every day. Honestly, perfect for travel, but the proprietary paper isn&rsquo;t cheap.</p>
<p>I thought I had previously read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rising">Red Rising</a> but it turns out I hadn&rsquo;t, and I completely loved this book, the universe building, and the characters. Highly recommend if you are into Science Fiction and/or Roman influenced culture. I&rsquo;m reading the second book now, and will probably just power through the whole set while I travel. Side note that I love my Kindle Colorsoft.</p>

			 <p>No excuses, I&rsquo;ve been pretty bad at updating over the last few months. Here&rsquo;s an Autumn Edition of the Weekly Bump, and maybe it should be call Seasonal Bump but I&rsquo;m stubborn.</p>
<p>I continue to mend from the spinal surgery I had in May. I&rsquo;ve now been cleared to do whatever I want, but some days, it still hurts. I&rsquo;m slowly adding things like rowing and pushups to my routine.</p>
<p>I voted Monday. Please vote. 🇺🇸</p>
<p>Some things I&rsquo;ve been enjoying.</p>
<p>Loving my new <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>. I went down a size from the Max to the regular sized pro phone this year, and so far I like it. I was using the Apple Silicon case but now have settled on <a href="https://www.nativeunion.com/products/reclassic-case-for-iphone-16?variant=42708262453387">this Native Union case</a>.  This case has a nice tactile feel, and the angle of the cutouts for the Camera Control is pleasing and very usable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.target.com/p/landon-tyler-5oz-lidded-glass-candle-spiced-pumpkin/-/A-91117694#lnk=sametab">This autumnal candle</a> is both inexpensive and enjoyable. I have burned it so much that it&rsquo;s almost gone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7l2fZ-OjU">This Lake Como video</a> is a place of peace playing over my desk here in Decatur. I do mute the music, sometimes.</p>
<p>We attended <a href="https://www.oystersouth.com/events/2024/5/2/landlocked-8">Landlocked</a> this weekend, I think our third year in a row. Tickets sold out in less than an hour. Oysters were eaten, a spicy tostada from Gene&rsquo;s was spicy, and many boat drinks and beers were enjoyed. Great to be able to support <a href="https://www.oystersouth.com">Oyster South</a> while having so much fun.</p>

It allows me to post to all three of the post-Twitter platforms I have been using.  Very easy to setup, use, and well designed. I do hope for, and request, iPad support.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a few weeks since I&rsquo;ve done one of these. No excuses, but I&rsquo;m also not putting too much pressure on myself. We went to the beach for a week, and I was at E3, which I should probably write something about.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s Summer and we went to the beach, one thing that&rsquo;s been top of mind for me has been sunglasses. I&rsquo;ve typically worn Ray Bans, which are $100+ a pair. Not all sunglasses look good on me, but the Wayfarer models usually look okay. Unfortunately, I have a horrible track record of scratching or losing them. At $100+ a pop, that&rsquo;s shitty.  Additionally, I have an iPhone X, and actual Ray Ban Wayfarers don&rsquo;t typically work with FaceID.</p>
<p>Enter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Goodr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I discovered this brand via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a professional runner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who I follow on Instagram. (I follow a bunch of fitness athletes on Instagram. It&rsquo;s one of my strategies for keeping myself motivated and inspired to work out myself.)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Goodr glasses are roughly Wayfarer shaped, but they only cost $25 a pair. They also, although you mileage may vary by color, work with FaceID. So I can lose or damage a pair of these, and not feel like I wasted a C Note. They also make pretty rad holiday color ways. The most recent is the &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Betsy Ross<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; pictured above, which I purchased for my 4th of July fun.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I&rsquo;m not getting any referral credit or anything, I am just recommending these glasses because I think they are great.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>One other item I wanted to call attention to this week is the limited availability of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new Hypercritical shirts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Siracusa<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  As a long time fan of his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reviews<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, podcasts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->old<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and social media, I own one of the original shirts, but was delighted that these were available, and in new colors. I went for the color pictured, but there are others. I have found that I have too many black t-shirts, and I am feeling the need to mix it up a bit more. These shirts are only available until June 29th, so better get hopping and get one if you&rsquo;re going to want one.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Andys are at it again. They will be conducting an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XOXO Festival<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Portland this year, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the registration application is currently available<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, through June 29th. I have attended three of the previous XOXO Festivals. All of them were great experiences, I met great people, was exposed to interesting ideas, and left inspired and refreshed. I could not recommend it more. Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t fit into my September calendar. We&rsquo;re taking the kids to Walt Disney World for a week the following week.  Hopefully I can still get some of those sweet sweet XOXO Field Notes if they make them.</p>
<p>See you next week?  I hope so.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Hope everyone&rsquo;s had a great week.  It feels like Spring has officially sprung here in the Atlanta area. Last weekend was crazy busy, with a really enjoyable Foo Fighters show, which was the first ever concert at the newly renamed Georgia State Stadium, which used to be Turner Field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been kind of a mundane week, with the exception of moving my office at work, which always is a distraction. I had been in my existing office for almost exactly a year, and while I will miss it&rsquo;s quiet corner of the world charm, the new one is more centrally located for what I&rsquo;m working on. It probably took me about three days total to get comfortable with the new setup.</p>
<p>Each week, this post has gone a couple of days later&hellip;Now on to things I&rsquo;m enjoying.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, I got a chance to try some peated bourbon for the first time, and I have to say that it&rsquo;s really grown on me. It&rsquo;s definitely not the first thing I reach for every time, but it&rsquo;s a unique taste that I have come to enjoy. Specifically, the peated bourbon from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kings County Distillery<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There&rsquo;s definitely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a debate about whether it still should be considered bourbon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I honestly don&rsquo;t care, it&rsquo;s really good.  Two warnings, it&rsquo;s not cheap, and not super easy to find.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In keyboard addiction news, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->these Zambumon GMK Serika Custom key caps<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are currently available to back on Massdrop. (That&rsquo;s an affiliate link.) These look really high quality, and really nice. I already have a keyboard in mind for them. I&rsquo;ve had really good luck backing key caps on Massdrop. Again, not cheap, but so nice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Finally, I read the first two issues of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Weapon H<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a sort of mashup between the Hulk and the Weapon X series. I have found these really enjoyable reads, and it&rsquo;s a cool idea. Can&rsquo;t wait for the rest of them to come out.</p>
<p> </p>

			 <p>What a great weekend, we didn&rsquo;t do much out of the ordinary, but it was a really relaxing and constructive couple of days, with some high quality NBA Playoff games, and an Atlanta United victory mixed in. I&rsquo;m continuing to take it easy, and my energy has returned, albeit slowly. I mostly played Hearthstone and Vainglory over the weekend, I want to play more PC games, but didn&rsquo;t feel like shutting myself off from the family to play this weekend.</p>
<p>We finished our Lego Ship in a Bottle this weekend. Lots of little pieces.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I did also take my sons to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pop&rsquo;s Pancakes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pop up at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Spindle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Sunday. If you have the chance to try these pancakes from my buddy Jeff, you definitely should check them out. I had the breakfast sandwich with Delia&rsquo;s Chicken Sausage, and I am hooked.</p>
<p>A couple of Kickstarters of note that I wanted to mention. Both are fully funded.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Time is starting to wind down on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mark One Pen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the Studio Neat guys. This pen checks all the boxes, and my friends over at the Pen Addict podcast had nothing but nice things to say about it, which is good enough for me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The second one is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kira Mechanical Keyboard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Input Club<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. These guys really know how to put together a nice board, and I currently have and use a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->White Fox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at home.  This board is unique in that it&rsquo;s the smallest footprint you can squeeze a full sized keyboard into. It&rsquo;s a bit pricey, but compared to similar keyboards, it&rsquo;s a good price for the high quality they produce.</p>
<p>Some things I am enjoying.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Picked up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Schon DSGN Limited Edition<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ldquo;Punk Rock Pink&rdquo; pen a couple of weeks ago, and it&rsquo;s become my EDC pocket pen. I&rsquo;ve always like the Fischer Space Pen refill, and this colorway is striking. This color is sold out, but they have a lot of other combinations that are equally as nice.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Upgraded my computer audio monitors to these <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mackie Monitors<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. (Amazon affiliate link) I had been using the same Bose setup for maybe ten years before this. These speakers also support Bluetooth, so I can pipe other audio to them when I am not using my gaming PC. They sound great, and are small enough that I didn&rsquo;t really have to make any huge changes. I am running out of plugs to power things in my home office.</p>
<p>Finally, I ran my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter account through Watson<!-- raw HTML omitted --> after reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this Kottke post about Watson Personality Insights<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what came back for me:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Still processing that.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;d aimed to have this done on Monday, but my energy levels have been all over the place the last few days, and I just never got to it. Small subtext is that I had a medical situation a couple of weeks ago, and am recovering from it, but slowly. The energy levels are really the last thing to get back to normal when you don&rsquo;t eat for a few days. I won&rsquo;t get more specific than that, I&rsquo;m reluctant to post medical related information on the internet or social media.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Like most of the gaming world, I&rsquo;ve really been enjoying <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fortnite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this week and for the last month or so. For those who aren&rsquo;t gaming adjacent, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Battle Royale<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; style game that has skyrocketed in popularity. The game is available across a wide variety of platforms, but I play on PC. I am &ldquo;bumpish&rdquo; should you want to friend and play with me, but don&rsquo;t set your expectations too high on what my level of skill might be. I&rsquo;d love to play with you in any case. I&rsquo;m only on a few times a week, and for a brief time, I don&rsquo;t get much dedicated PC gaming in these days with family duties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also enjoying the rollover to the Year of the Raven in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hearthstone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which happened this week with the release of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Witchwood expansion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I exalt in the end of the mill deck era. There is one card, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shudderwock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is totally broken and makes things less fun than they could be. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s a great video<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Disguised Toast that elaborates on how broken, at least the animations, if not the whole mechanic are.</p>
<p>I did go to the Atlanta Pen Show for a couple of hours until I ran out of gas.  My new purchases were an &ldquo;Aiken&rdquo; pen from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Carolina Pen Company<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is colored to look like the Northern Lights using the same material as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this pen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seed A5 case<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from my friends at Nock.</p>
<p>I did also buy some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gigante Note Cards<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Nock while I had the chance in person. These folded over notecards are a favorite of mine, and I keep a couple in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my pocket sheath<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with me all the time. They are essentially the smallest available notebook, with only 4 pages.</p>
<p>Top of mind for me on the music side is Black Moon Rising from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Black Pumas<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There are listen links for a variety of music services on that page. At first I thought it was Cee-Lo Green, but it&rsquo;s not. I haven&rsquo;t been able to find anything else by them, they are from Austin, TX.</p>
<p>Last night we watched the first episode of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Pastry Chef season of Chef&rsquo;s Table<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christina Tosi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Milk Bar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  If you have Netflix, I highly recommend this episode, I found it really inspiring. Be careful though, you can order just about anything in the episode from their web site. My cookies are on the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about getting a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ReMarkable Tablet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> based on the recommendation of some folks online who swear by it.  Seems like it might either completely replace my work notebook, or it won&rsquo;t work for me at all though, making the price tag a little tough to swallow. The iPad hasn&rsquo;t really worked for me for this particular use case, and I love my e-ink Kindles, so the idea of the product might be in my sweet spot.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After struggling for a few months with wanting to update this site more, I think I&rsquo;ve come up with a strategy, at least to start. I am going to try and do one of these &ldquo;Weekly Bump&rdquo; posts every Monday morning. Hopefully that will lead to more posts, but we&rsquo;ll see.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Looking ahead to this week, I&rsquo;m pretty excited for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Atlanta Pen Show<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which starts Friday, April 13th and runs through the weekend. It&rsquo;s always nice to see everyone in the pen community, although I never get to spend as much time up there as I&rsquo;d like. I&rsquo;m not heading up there this week with any specific pen in mind.</p>
<p>Looking even further ahead, I&rsquo;m super excited about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this new restaurant<!-- raw HTML omitted --> opening in Midtown Atlanta soon from the team that runs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brush Sushi Izakaya<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Decatur. Brush is one of my favorite Atlanta spots, and is walking distance from our home.</p>
<p>Here are some things I enjoyed in the last week.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Charlie Gray&rsquo;s Instagram feed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has some amazing portraits, with the most recent batch being focused on the new Wes Anderson movie, including <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this striking one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of Bill Murray.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed listening to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Talk Show ✪: Ep. 217, With Special Guest Jason Kottke<!-- raw HTML omitted --> As a longtime super fan of both guys, this was one of my favorite podcast episodes so far this year. Even more so given that I feel like I have lived a lot of the subject matter in real time over the last 20 years. (This blog is 22 years old this year.)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why I Love Compact Mechanical Keyboards and You Will Too<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: from The Wirecutter. I am about two years down this rabbit hole myself, and this post is the perfect place to start.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed Bladerunner 2049, and I am a huge Run the Jewels fan. I was astonished when El-P shared <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his rejected Blade Runner 2049 Trailer Score<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. While I like the Hans Zimmer score, what could have been is apparent. Looking forward to the movie that EL-P is going to score this year, which hasn&rsquo;t been announced yet.</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are so many apps that I could write about here. I spend a lot of time on my iPad, iPhone, Mac and Apple Watch. This isn’t a comprehensive look at what I use, just some high notes. For instance, I probably use my iPad about 35% of the time for reading across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instapaper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kindle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> app, but that’s all the mention they get.</p>
<p>I’m writing this using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bear<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my iPad. Bear has become the latest in a line of notepad apps that I have used as a junk drawer for my information. I occasionally take a quick look to see where <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple’s Notes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simplenote<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are, both served this role for some time after I abandoned Evernote. Both offer the one thing that has made me reconsider Bear, a web interface to my text. (Bear has one currently under development, but with no announced release date.) What Bear does offer is a really nice clean interface, good tagging support, and first class apps on iPad, Mac and iPhone. It also offers a good community and developers who are actively working to improve the apps. It’s a joy to use, and I happily will let my subscription renew.</p>
<p>I’ve used a lot of weather apps over the years, but I have currently settled on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hello Weather<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It offers a clean, uncluttered UI, but without redacting any of the information that I want my weather app to include.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time this year trying out different podcast apps, but ultimately ended up back where I started, using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. What drove me to look at the other options was the lack of a good working web player or desktop app for Mac. Overcast offers the best iOS app, bar none, in my opinion, and in the end, that won out over the presence of better web players from other developers for me. It would be nice if he made some quality of life enhancements to the web player, but I have taken to just always listening from my phone for now.</p>
<p>I have (I just counted.) 45 photography apps installed on my phone. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Darkroom<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has become the default app for editing and touch ups once I have taken the shot and gotten the image onto my phone, if shot with a camera. It offers really clean workflow that matches how I think about editing images. I still also use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VSCO<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Priime<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and am also trying out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TouchRetouch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I currently have a 429 day streak of checking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Timehop<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This lovely little app lets me look into what I was doing in previous years across social media and the photos on my device. Most of my social time is spent using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tweetbot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instagram<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Tweetbot offers fantastic list support and I use Twitter in a very list-centric manner, so it maps well for me on all my devices. I continue to miss the days of 3rd party Instagram apps for the iPad. I’ve taken to using their web site on my iPad instead of blowing their iPhone app up 2x.</p>
<p>As a lot of this year was dedicated to fitness, it shouldn’t be a surprise that the Activity app from Apple is something I use religiously. My wife and I share our activity goal data, allowing us to encourage each other to do well. I can’t understate the big help that this app and the Apple Watch have been for me as I try to push myself to become more fit and healthy. Late in the year, after I got my Series 3 Apple Watch, I also started using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HeartWatch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AutoSleep<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Both offer more data than the base Activity app, specifically around sleep efficiency and heart rate data.</p>
<p>In a related vein, since I listen to music while working out, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spotify<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has become a key app on my phone and my main music app. I maintain a subscription to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Music<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well, and use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SoundCloud<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mixcloud<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for DJ mixes predominantly, but Spotify rules the day because of it’s device support, social features and better recommendation engine. I could play Spotify through my new living room home entertainment gear on the day it arrived without any additional hardware or effort. If I had to drop a subscription, it would be Apple Music. They just haven’t improved it enough since launch.</p>
<p>Which brings me to games. Two games have remained on my home screen throughout the year, and probably will stay there for some time to come. I’ve been playing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hearthstone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> since launch, and still enjoy the most recent expansions. Blizzard have done a great job of fostering new content. When I want to get a little more tappy and engaged, I fire up <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VainGlory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I mostly play their Battle Royale mode. They have built a very responsive MOBA, and I look forward to the release of 5v5 play in January.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been an exciting month. What seemed like a quick casual conversation with my wife turned into house hunting, mortgage shopping, and the eventual purchase of a new home.  As our two boys have gotten older, the existing house was feeling smaller and smaller. The new house is a lot bigger, and is walking distance to the elementary school that my sons will attend.</p>
<p>In the last two weeks, we&rsquo;ve moved in, and I now find myself wondering how soon we&rsquo;ll reach a stable state. Our new home is gorgeous, and I can&rsquo;t wait to get to the point where we feel like we&rsquo;re unpacked. Right now, most things are still in boxes. I haven&rsquo;t even unpacked a single box in my home office.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how much the first few days after a move feel almost like camping, as you unpack just the most critical items, then less critical ones. It feels like a set of systems that you&rsquo;re bringing online.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of issues, as I guess everyone does in the home buying and moving process. We had three different closing dates as the builder was unable to manage the schedule with inspections to get the CO. We bought a refrigerator to match the appliances our builder had already put in the kitchen, only to discover that it wouldn&rsquo;t fit upon delivery, requiring some additional custom cabinet work, which he&rsquo;s now asking us to pay for.  Our washer and dryer do not fit in the laundry room in such a way that the door can be closed. All of these sharp edges will get smoothed out over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Our address is new, there was no house there before we moved in. This has caused a number of issues ranging from Comcast not even being willing to give us service, to not being able to change our bank accounts and the billing addresses on things because postal lookups were failing.  Comcast thing worked out great because we&rsquo;re getting Gigabit Fiber from AT&amp;T instead, which is better, faster, and more stable.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve been thinking since last weekend that I should write something up about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ELEAGUE CS:GO Major<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that  just happened. This event was a watershed week for our business, but also a marker in my career.  This is from my perspective, and I should be clear that this is from me, not my employer. Any opinions are my opinions, and not theirs. The facts belong to us all though.</p>
<p>For those who might not be familiar, or weren&rsquo;t following along, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this tournament<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was one of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the most successful in esports history<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a number of ways. It was the first CS:GO Major tournament with a televised Final, which was on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TBS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> here in the US. It was a tournament with some of the best and most competitive gameplay in the history of these tournaments, something we clearly can&rsquo;t take credit for, but which is a testament to the state of competitive CS:GO. A team named Astralis triumphed in the end, and during that final amazing match, we broke the all time Twitch maximum concurrent users record for a single channel, smashing the previous high mark by over 200,000, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->becoming the first channel to ever go over 1 million concurrents<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  There&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an awesome Instagram video<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, captured by a Twitch engineer friend, which captures my awkward enthusiasm in the moment that we crested that 1 million mark.</p>
<p>The tournament was held here in Atlanta, first at the ELEAGUE studio on our campus in midtown, with the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals then being held at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fox Theatre<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a venue at which I have attended concerts, plays, and even a movie or two. It was incredibly cool to work an event in my adopted hometown of almost twenty years. While I have worked many NBA All-Star games and golf events while working for Turner, none of them have ever been here in Atlanta. That somehow made this more real and meaningful for me.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In many ways, this  event was no different, from a work perspective, than one of the seven NBA &ldquo;season starts&rdquo; I worked on, or an NBA All-Star Weekend, or a PGA Championship, or the Ryder Cup that I wrote the software for onsite the week of the tournament. This event left a huge 14-day gaping hole in my life, every waking moment those 14 days I was thinking about or doing work. We spent well over a hundred hours the week of the tournament getting ready for each day, working the competition, and making sure that things were updated at the end of the night. These kind of hours have an impact of those around us, and I am more cognizant of that than ever these days. I&rsquo;m not the only one in our home who is exhausted from the long days. I missed my kids and my wife, and they assure me that they missed me. When working with live sports or live events, this is how it is, what it takes to be successful. There are a multitude of details that need to be carefully tended to, and it has to be on a specific time scale that is not negotiable.  I am incredibly proud of the entire team that worked on this event. There were no major outages, our Twitch stream stayed up with no downtime. We ran our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Game Command player<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for more matches in a week than we&rsquo;ve ever run it before. In fact, I believe we ran it for more hours for the Major than every other time we&rsquo;ve run it combined.</p>
<p>So with all this background information, what did this event mean to me? To understand that, I need to provide just a little more context. First, it was the culmination of an 18th month journey for me. I was asked to first help with, and then work on, Turner&rsquo;s esports initiatives. I had an amazing job working on the NBA&rsquo;s products in the US at the time, and I personally took a big chance on esports because I was passionate about it and ready for something new. I had no idea what it would turn into for Turner, and there were no promises about what my role would be moving forward. We started 18 months ago with a vision for what we wanted to do, and the rest has been a wild ride right into this weekend.</p>
<p>I could have never imagined that Valve, the publisher of CS:GO, would choose us to host a Major in our first year of existence. I couldn&rsquo;t have guessed, even the morning of the Final, that we would break the single channel traffic record on Twitch. So much of that relies on the quality of the matches, and the interest of the fans. If the match had ended after two maps, we never would have broken the record. In any case, even if we hadn&rsquo;t broken that record, we&rsquo;ve accomplished so much in a short period of time, starting from nothing, building a team, hosting events. Not everything has been perfect, nor has every decision been a winner, but we&rsquo;ve learned from every mistake, and taken all the fan feedback very seriously, and I think it shows. That&rsquo;s how we roll.</p>
<p>So, this meant a lot to me, more in some ways than anything I have helped build in my career.  I may not work in esports forever, but the memory of this event, especially, across everything we&rsquo;ve done with ELEAGUE in it&rsquo;s first year, will always be with me, a reminder that if you just keep going and try hard, and do your best, good things happen.</p>

<p>I really like(d) Vesper, but it never stuck for me. I was a day one user, mainly because I am huge fan of all three of these guys, and also consider their QA lead an internet friend.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they could have done differently, especially with only three of them, I do think that, for their core audience, there are three platforms that matter:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Only Brent, Dave and John know for sure, but from my outsider&rsquo;s view, this was a part time job for all three of them. I suspect that if even one of them had made this more of a full time job, it might have generated perspective and possibly drive to succeed. Just guessing on that bit, and I could be completely wrong.</p>

<p>ELEAGUE has been a very interesting ride for me, particularly because I was literally the first person working full time on esports at Turner.  I may be able to write more about that ride at some point, but I have to say that I&rsquo;m really proud of what we accomplished right out of the gate.

<p>Since reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matthew&rsquo;s review<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I decided to jot down a few thoughts on this item as well. I&rsquo;m not sure when Nock will make it available to regular people via their site, but well, home field advantage. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update: These are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->going live<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at Noon today, November 30th, 2015. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I picked up one of these cases in waxed canvas a few weeks ago when Nock Co. had a booth at a pop up shop for American made goods at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ponce City Market<!-- raw HTML omitted --> here in Atlanta. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Like Matthew says in his review<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, this thing is boss. I like mine so much that it&rsquo;s become a permanent part of my backpack load out, and I think I want to pick up a second one.</p>
<p>I have been using Field Notes for my Bullet Journal pursuits for the last few weeks, and so this is a good match, I keep a couple of recently filled notebooks, and the next one I am going to use.  I have been carrying three pens, each with a different load out.</p>
<p>I also keep a few <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Frictionless Capture Cards<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tucked in.  Sadly, they went out of business, and once my current supply of these cards is gone, I will probably move on to these <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nock Co. DotDash Cards<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d read or heard, I think on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Pen Addict podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that the case doesn&rsquo;t quite hold an iPhone 6 Plus, but mine actually does hold one and zip up. That&rsquo;s actually why I think I might pick up a second Sinclair case, as I have a work 6 plus that I keep in my daily carry backpack monstrosity. Here&rsquo;s a shot of my 6 plus tucked into the Sinclair.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m totally sold on this case, and highly recommend it. Nock Co. makes really high quality product right here in Atlanta, and I&rsquo;ve never had any issues or been disappointed with anything I have bought from them. I think I might grab a couple of zipper pulls from them after seeing Matthews configuration, but otherwise, this is the perfect carry for my Field Notes, Word Notebooks, and three pens, which is the most I really would use anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also love to see one of these in a larger size that was designed to hold a Hobonichi Techo. There&rsquo;s such a lack of good cases that are meant to hold the Techo, and it&rsquo;s gotten more popular. Seems like a real market opportunity to me.</p>

<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->L16 from Light<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, pictured above, is all over the web this week. You can reserve one at a reduced price by putting $199 down by November 6th. It&rsquo;s an Android based, slightly-bigger-than-phone sized camera that looks to replace DSLR cameras by utilizing an array of  cheaper and smaller cameras carefully orchestrated by software.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for things like this in the gadget space, but I am having a hard time convincing myself to put down the money now for something I won&rsquo;t get until Summer 2016. All this without an chance to try the device myself, or even have someone I trust with hands on experience vouch for it. The movie in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Core77 article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> provides a little additional information, but I think i will be debating this until the November 6th deadline.</p>
<p>I have been debating selling my whole Canon DSLR setup of late. I am not using it nearly as much as I used to. I wonder if I wouldn&rsquo;t be better off with the smallest nearly equivalent camera.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Up until a week ago, my main carry phone was an iPhone 6. I replaced it with an iPhone 6s Plus, which arrived on launch day, but, due to some work travel, I have only had it since Sunday, for five days. Here are some high level observations from those five days of using this new device.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m quite pleased with the new device itself, especially the obvious hardware improvements. Having said that, and I have had every iPhone to date, this was the least smooth transition from one phone to another on the software side. I am still working on getting my new phone to the place my old phone already was. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review, I don&rsquo;t have the patience or time these days to do that.</p>
<p>This phone feels ridiculously fast, faster than my iPad Air 2 even.</p>
<p>The battery life seems a little worse than my couple of months old iPhone 6 Plus.</p>
<p>My initial observation was that this phone is heavier than the existing iPhone 6 Plus, but still comfortable to me for extended use and carry. I purchased an Apple silicone case, I have been very happy with the 2014 silicone case that my work iPhone 6 Plus is in. I am a little disappointed in the 2015 silicone case, it&rsquo;s got a smoother finish, and feels less grippy in your hand. As a result, I feel the phone slipping in my hand a little when I am not expecting it. I may end up getting another case that has a better tactile feel to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Touch ID<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it&rsquo;s significantly faster with the new phone for both Apple Pay and unlocking the device. It&rsquo;s so fast, in fact, that I am sometimes accidentally unlocking the device when I wanted to wake the phone up to see the time.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3D Touch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seems to have a ton of potential. It turns out that I am a &ldquo;hard presser&rdquo; to begin with, and so my long touches are often being interpreted as a 3D Touch. Once I understood the pressure differential, mainly while I was re-organizing my home screen, things locked into place, and now I have the hang of it. It will take even longer for me to get into the routine of thinking to use it.</p>
<p>The camera is noticeably better, and was one of my main reasons for upgrading the phone. Focus is faster, and low light photos look better to me. I am not sure that I am that enchanted with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Live Photos<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but that may just be that I haven&rsquo;t taken many yet. Since a lot of what I do with my pictures is sharing via Instagram and Facebook, I am not sure I will use Live Photos much until they are supported on those platforms.</p>
<p>So now a few words about the transition from my iPhone 6 to this new phone, which has not been a good experience. First, I was a part of the iOS 9 public beta this Summer. Not the developer releases, but the public beta. I did this because I thought it would mean a smoother landing when everything came out this fall. I was wrong. They rolled the people in the iOS 9 public beta right onto 9.1. Once you have backed up on 9.1, you can&rsquo;t restore onto 9. So I had to start with my last good backup from earlier this Summer. I understand what running a beta means, that there may be sharp edges. I think someone at Apple should have thought through the customer experience before just rolling everyone on to 9.1.</p>
<p>The transition between phones for Watch is terrible. You have to un-pair your watch from the phone, deleting everything off the watch, then re-pair it with your new phone, finally restoring from whatever your last backup was, and losing some data pretty much no matter what you do. So much room for improvement here.</p>
<p>Finally, I have relied on the Health app and Activity app as my primary activity and fitness trackers for the last few months. Shame on me for not looking into this more, but that data does not get backed up via iCloud backup. You can back it up by doing an encrypted iTunes backup, which I will now be forced to switch to. There is a way to migrate this data using two third party apps, and I am going to spend the time to try and do that this weekend. Very disappointing from a user experience standpoint though, seems like they are making the customer do too much work. I wouldn&rsquo;t expect to have to manually migrate this data myself.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update: It seems that Health and Activity data is in the iCloud backup after all, but some folks, myself included, are having issues with getting it to the new devices.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I definitely love my Apple Watch. I ordered the Stainless Steel Apple Watch with a black sport band at 12:01 am on the night they went on sale, received it the very first day they shipped, and haven&rsquo;t really taken it off, except for charging, since. I really like the black sport band, but have wanted to pick up more bands as well.  I see the sport band as a good every day band, and only really liked the black color. I wanted some variety, but found the other Apple options to not really be for me when I tried them on in store.  A few weeks ago, when the Monowear bands went up for pre-order, I placed an order for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Monowear red nylon band<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I received the band while I was away at WWDC, and was pretty excited to try it out when I got home. I liked the red color as a contrast to the black band I have been wearing. I have to say that I am not disappointed in this band in any way.  I like it so much that I may be ordering additional bands from Monowear in the near future. Given the current dearth of third party bands that are available, and the premium construction, I don&rsquo;t think the $59.99 price tag is unreasonable.</p>
<p>The band installed flawlessly on my watch, as easily as any of the Apple bands. Removing and re-installing my Apple Sport Band also proved to be a breeze.  I was definitely concerned about this the most of the various aspects of this purchase, and this band passed with flying colors.</p>
<p>The band itself is well made, and its metal matches the Apple Watch hardware color perfectly. This includes the three band loops, as well as the small pieces that attach the band to the watch body. I can&rsquo;t find any flaws there at all. The nylon is what I would expect from a premium nylon watch band. It came out of the packaging a little stiff, and so will be a little itchy/scratchy the first few days until it&rsquo;s fully broken in, but I think that&rsquo;s to be expected.</p>
<p>Overall, this band is a good option for those seeking a red band, something Apple does not offer. I&rsquo;d really like to try out their leather bands next, but may have to wait for my next paycheck to make that purchase. Keep in mind that I have only had/worn this band for about 36 hours, and my opinion may change with wear, but, for now, it&rsquo;s a definite go ahead and buy rating.</p>

<p>Studio Neat recently introduced a new free app named <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Highball<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I was just thinking last week that there didn&rsquo;t seem to be a lot of good apps for storing cocktail recipes, surprising given how in vogue fancy cocktails seem to be at the moment. The price is right, and the app is responsive and well designed. It&rsquo;s a natural extension of their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neat Ice Kit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simple Syrup Kit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> products, both of which are on my future purchase list.</p>
<p>More interesting to me is the way they have implemented cocktail recipe sharing. You can either take a picture of the card some else has shared, which has an embedded QR code, (It&rsquo;s small, but it&rsquo;s still a QR code.) or you can enter a unique number that is assigned to that recipe in their database of recipes. Definitely a pretty elegant solution to a pretty thorny problem. Send me your recipes!</p>

			 <p>I was reading Lopp&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bulleted list of observations on watches<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is definitely worth your time, and this one stuck out to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interaction with a watch is measured in seconds and rarely minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This definitely implies that people are going to be using the wrist device for quick bursts, but not for any sustained time period.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, I read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Kevin Tofel that makes the case for Watch apps being &ldquo;usable&rdquo; in ten seconds or less.</p>
<p>I actually agree that the first generation of apps for these devices are more than likely going to be for small burst activities.  I think, however, that that will be because most people haven&rsquo;t had access to a device prior to this first release of apps.  It may also be because of battery life, but that remains to be seen at the moment, I expect we will know more tomorrow.</p>
<p>I think that this device will, in the more long term, be used for longer things than people realize at the moment.  I keep imagining some addictive watch based game that people play. Think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tamogotchi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for your wrist (which I imagine someone has to be making the equivalent of somewhere at this very moment) and you have the general idea. I think that the limiting factor, aside from the aforementioned battery life concern, is that people will think of this like a watch until they don&rsquo;t.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve only had my iPhone 6 for about twenty four hours, but here&rsquo;s some of my first impressions. I upgraded from an iPhone 5S. This is not intended to be a full review, nor do I intend to do one. It&rsquo;s also not a review of iOS 8, you should read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you want that. I went for the iPhone 6 Space Gray, 128 Gb. My carrier is AT&amp;T.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->First, the software and data transition between phones was the easiest one I have ever done. I had upgraded my 5S to iOS 8 last week, and did a lot of purging beforehand to make sure my backup was as small as possible. Having said that, I was up and running pretty quickly, and most everything just works today. iCloud keychain, and iCloud backups, have taken this process lightyears ahead of the &ldquo;old days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a fistful of phone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for me, but not too big by any means. I can reach all areas of the screen. Your mileage may vary based on your hand size and dexterity, but I am totally comfortable with the size of the phone.</p>
<p>That screen! Wow. The colors, the resolution, it looks amazing. Feels like a substantial upgrade from the 5S screen to me. Not just the size, but also the quality.</p>
<p>The Sleep/Wake button location change to the side of the device went against my muscle memory for the first few hours of use, but today it seems like I&rsquo;m well on my way to getting used to this change.</p>
<p>It worked, without any obvious issues, with my car kit and other accessories, except for my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Elevation Dock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which it doesn&rsquo;t fit in. (Anyone want to buy an Elevation Dock for their 5S or 5C?)</p>
<p>I went for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Leather Case (Black)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because I used the same/similar case from Apple on my iPhone 5S. I&rsquo;m not disappointed in any way, it feels great. I think that most people will want a case for this phone, it&rsquo;s very smooth and rounded, and I think, easier to drop than the last four iPhones.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t taken many pictures yet, but the pictures I took to test looked markedly better than similar shots with my iPhone 5S.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very enthusiastic about this device. It seems better in all the right ways.  It&rsquo;s not really worse in any way that I have found after a day.</p>

<p>Every year, I find this night a little overwhelming as I try to read and digest the opinions of a catalog of people who I trust, and, in some cases, revere, for their opinions on this stuff. This is kind of hilarious in that every previous year at this point I&rsquo;ve already ordered my device.  This year, however, more than any other, I was reading these reviews hoping that I haven&rsquo;t made the wrong decision in which device I ordered. Really for the first time in the iPhone&rsquo;s history, there are two &ldquo;top of the line&rdquo; devices to choose from. Did I get it right?</p>
<p>I ordered an iPhone 6 Plus at 3:40 am ET last Friday, after 4o frustrating minutes of trying to order a phone while simultaneously reloading Twitter to see if others had been successful.  My reasoning behind choosing the iPhone 6 Plus was that I wanted the extra battery life, and that, given how much I value the pictures I take with the device, that the camera with optical stabilization would be something that I would want.</p>
<p>I had printed out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the PDF of the devices<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and cut them out. It did nag at me a little that the 6 Plus was the same size as my (work provided) Samsung Galaxy Note 3. When my order went through, the app informed me that my device would be shipping the first week in October. Unacceptable, but I went back to bed anyway.</p>
<p>The next morning, I found that there were iPhone 6, Space Gray, 128 Gb still available for store pickup at two of my local Apple stores with a 9/19 availability date. I cancelled my iPhone 6 Plus order, and placed one for an iPhone 6 for pick up. (I can&rsquo;t pick mine up until Monday because I am out of town at a family wedding the next few days.) I&rsquo;m hoping that I don&rsquo;t spend much time in the next 12 months regretting that decision. My reasoning was that the iPhone 6 is still a good jump from the iPhone 5S I am using now in terms of size.  We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some thoughts on a few reviews from around the web. I don&rsquo;t intend this post to be a summary of the reviews, or a review of reviews, it&rsquo;s mostly my reaction to each.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daring Fireball - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The iPhones 6<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by John Gruber<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This review made me feel a little better about my decision to go with the iPhone 6, particularly this part, where he makes his recommendations.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->MacWorld - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus review: Bigger is in fact better (in the right hands)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Jason Snell<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one heck of a line wrapping title. Jason does a great job of putting this set of device releases in the context of the history of iPhone releases at the beginning of the review. He seems to feel almost exactly the same way that Gruber does about the 6 Plus.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On a side note, Jason Snell has left MacWorld, and has a new site, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six Colors<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  There are some interesting deeper insights about the screens and display technology in his first article on that site, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone 6 &amp; iPhone 6 Plus: A tale of scale<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Looking forward to seeing what else he does with his newfound freedom.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Verge - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone 6 Review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by David Pierce,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone 6 Plus Review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Nilay Patel<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>First, I think that it was a curious decision to do these as two separate reviews by two different writers. The two reviews above got this right, in my opinion. A single review for both makes for better reading, and they are so similar in so many ways, that this style of review is more efficient for the reader.</p>
<p>The iPhone 6 review does a good job of putting this phone, and it&rsquo;s size, in the context of the larger market, fairly comparing it to the Android devices that the Daring Fireballs and MacWorlds would typically not mention.  This review has the nicest product photography and better screen shots than any other review I have looked at for these phones as well. It talks more about iOS 8 than the previous two as well, mentioning Spotlight for instance.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The iPhone 6 plus review did cause me some regret. Particularly this section on battery.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I would be doing The Verge a disservice if I didn&rsquo;t mention how well done the video reviews are. Both are excellent, and I found myself wondering why some of the other publications/sites don&rsquo;t do this, as it&rsquo;s way more revealing about a product like the iPhone than a written review with some screenshots.  I especially  enjoyed the shot of the reviewer walking by the line at the 5th Avenue Apple Store in Manhattan, walking past the people waiting in line for the iPhone 6 while talking on the iPhone 6.  Funny.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York Times - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Review and Video: With Big New iPhones, It’s the iOS 8 Software Inside That Counts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Molly Wood<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This one is another combo written review and video review in a single page. The written review sticks to the basics, and really steers clear of making a recommendation, as I think you would expect from a more mainstream media review.</p>
<p>The video review is excellent, and seeing the phones in her hands was great. It made me realize just how huge the iPhone 6 Plus is going to be for people with smaller hands. (Which I don&rsquo;t have.) The video review has a lot more flavor and opinion to it, and I wish that had come through more in the written review.</p>
<p>Neither review impacted my possible buyer&rsquo;s remorse.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m pushing this post out, but plan on adding additional reviews today as time allows.  There are a lot of reviews. - RO 11:44 AM ET<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>The rewards include a custom printed Bullet Journal notebook, which seems like an interesting idea, albeit a little antithetical to the overall idea of Bullet Journal in the first place. Of course, I was in the moment I saw the Kickstarter, and have backed the project at the two notebook tier.</p>
<p>I feel like I owe Ryder a debt of gratitude because Bullet Journal has been so useful for me, and I am interested in seeing more ideas from other people on how I can evolve my Bullet Journal style. (The best thing for me would be neater handwriting, I need to work on that.) It&rsquo;s definitely a very accessible system, so it adapts well to a variety of needs, and varying levels of note taking skill. If you haven&rsquo;t checked it out yet, here&rsquo;s your chance.</p>

			 <p>This weekend, I was reading Twitter, minding my own business, when I ran across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this tweet by Nick Bilton<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It had this picture taken from a drone attached to it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p> </p>
<p>I saw this picture, and I was intrigued. A longtime lover of photography, I am really interested in the perspectives you could capture with a drone that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally be able to capture without a helicopter, or even without a helicopter.  As I do, I started searching for more information about using drones for photography, and discovered a few sites/posts with some great information.  First, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this post on the National Geographic web site.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Later, I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->skypixel.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which seems to be a very actively maintained blog with some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really striking<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->drone photography<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on it.  It also features this awesome <!-- raw HTML omitted -->getting started guide<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  If you are at all interested in this stuff, this seems like the page to bookmark to get started.</p>
<p>I have gone ahead and ordered <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a practice drone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Before I spend too much money on this, I want to be sure that it&rsquo;s something I enjoy doing, and that I can actually fly one of these things.  Even the bare bone drones plus a GoPro camera will end up setting you back a thousand dollars.  Although it looks like rentals are going to be available soon, keep reading.</p>
<p>A couple of days later, Jason Kottke posted this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Drone selfies post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the web exploded with drone photography interest.  The drone selfie video, which I have embedded below, was take at the same time as the shot above that Nick Bilton posted to Twitter.  It seems like this meme has exploded in the last few days, this led to more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->drone selfies<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or dronies.  Personally, I am more interested in taking high quality stills from unique perspectives than the videos, but I probably will reconsider once I have gear.</p>
<p>Amit Gupta, who took the Drone selfie below, has added Drone Photography gear rental to his awesome photography gear site, Photojojo.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Go here to check that out and sign up for more information<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Looks like they are launching on May 15th.  There&rsquo;s also a great guide to &ldquo;How to take a perfect Dronie&rdquo; on that page.</p>

<p>Instagram doesn&rsquo;t have an official iPad client. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Who knows why this is<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? I have used a bunch of different iPad apps, most recently <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Iris<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is also quite good, to use this service on my iPad.  Recently <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flow was released<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I really like it, I think it&rsquo;s the best Instagram client for iPad.</p>
<p>There are a few different reasons why I like this over the other alternatives out there.  First, it&rsquo;s all about the pictures.  As you can see from the image above, the app is designed to only be used in landscape orientation, and fits the maximum amount of pictures into the iPad viewport with a minimum of chrome.  Second, the app is snappy, and the transition animations between screens are well thought out, pleasing, yet not over the top.  Third, they&rsquo;ve made it easy to navigate the sea of pictures, allowing you to move picture to picture while viewing in detail mode.  Also of use, and well designed, are the abilities to search and bookmark specific tags, users and locations.  I have a small list that I check on a regular basis, for example <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#vscocam<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which yields a really nice set of pictures.  All the expected Instagram functionality you&rsquo;d expect is there, and well supported.</p>
<p>Flow is free to download, and does not currently contain any advertising, so I am not sure what their long term plan to make this app into a real business might be.  I guess I always wonder about this whenever I download a new app these days.  I&rsquo;d just much rather pay for the app than wonder what could happen in the future.  In this case, given that Instagram is still figuring out how to make money too, I think I would be a hypocrite to not use this free app when I am already using this free service.  The app is not perfect. The lack of portrait support, while not a deal killer, seems like an oddity in an otherwise well thought out application.   I&rsquo;ve also had to fiddle with it to get the pictures to refresh at times, but I do think, in lieu of an official Instagram client for iPad, that this is a really nice replacement.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In no particular order, here are five products/sites/services that I really enjoyed having/using this year. I could have written about more, but I&rsquo;m lazy.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedbin<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I am an RSS apex consumer, subscribing to about 500 sites' RSS feeds. I was in a complete panic earlier this year when Google Reader was going away. NetNewsWire and Reeder, synced with Google Reader, were mainstays of my way of staying informed. I used them every day, and rarely declared RSS bankruptcy. Feedbin saved my ass in 2013.</p>
<p>With Google Reader going away, there were a few choices out there, but most of them were free services. That&rsquo;s not what I wanted to use though. I wanted something that I could pay an honest fee for, that probably wouldn&rsquo;t be co-opted by other business motives, and I evaluated the options out there and picked <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedbin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>This service hasn&rsquo;t disappointed me one bit. It&rsquo;s been consistently improved throughout the year, and client support for it is fantastic. Best of all, their web app, through one of those updates, supports many of the keyboard commands from the legacy RSS reader I used for so long. I read my feeds on every device I carry using this service, using Reeder on iOS, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Press<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Android, and the Feedbin Web interface on desktop. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Press<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is awesome, and probably the best RSS Reader app on any platform in my opinion.)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cool Hunting T-Tech by Tumi Backpack<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I own a lot of gear bags because I carry a lot of gear on a daily basis, and I am always looking for the perfect system for carrying things. At <!-- raw HTML omitted -->work<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we support a lot of devices, and I need to have a few with me wherever I am to make sure that I can cover the support from where I happen to be.</p>
<p>I should probably do a post about what&rsquo;s in my bag when I head out to CES next week. On top of that, I usually carry a camera system of some kind, and then a myriad of chargers etc. Suffice it say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this bag<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is really really nice, well made, and can hold a lot of stuff. There are a lot of great bags out there, but this has been my mainstay since the day I got it in the first half of 2013. Since it&rsquo;s made by Tumi, I know that I can count on it. I have had some Tumi luggage for as long as fifteen years under a lot of travel, and it&rsquo;s held up remarkably well. If you need to carry a lot of stuff, and like the backpack form factor, I highly recommend this bag.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems to be sold out at this point. I&rsquo;ll be watching Cool Hunting for future product releases, they have great taste and attention to detail.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple TV<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Not new to this year, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this small device<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has really become the center of our living room in 2013. It already had a strong lineup of content, and AirPlay from our various iOS devices (my wife and I both have iPhones and iPads) has become a stock way we listen to music. Having a device at the center of our living room that is synced with our ever growing library of content in iTunes helps a lot. Integration with Flickr means that there&rsquo;s a scrolling slideshow of my most recent Flickr posts happening while we&rsquo;re listening to music.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I think, however, that there was a major shift that occurred in our home over the summer. This shift was caused by two things. June 19th, 2013, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HBO Go came to Apple TV<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We have DirecTV, and this meant it was like someone had bought us the boxed set of every single HBO show. The second event was Orange is the New Black coming to Netflix in July. Long time fans of Weeds, we loved this show produced by the same team, and we binge watched until they were all gone. Can&rsquo;t wait until there are more, but we&rsquo;re currently binging through Breaking Bad. We&rsquo;re not going to be canceling our DirecTV service any time soon, but more and more, we&rsquo;re watching stuff via this device. When we&rsquo;re not watching, this device is what&rsquo;s powering other living room entertainment.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evernote Smart Notebooks<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>As evidenced by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my post a couple of days ago<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evernote Smart Notebooks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in the linked configuration, have been a staple of my productivity regimen in 2013. They come with a three month extension to your Evernote Pro service. At the rate I use them, this means I won&rsquo;t be paying discretely for Evernote any time soon. It&rsquo;s that simple. I don&rsquo;t really use the stickers, but I do take a picture of every page. Just works. I was already hooked on Evernote long before these appeared.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wirecutter<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare that I trust a site&rsquo;s advice completely, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wirecutter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has earned that trust. Their exhaustive work in specific product categories has led to well informed purchases time and again throughout 2013. They are relentless in keeping their site and reviews up to date. I read through their deals very carefully. Some notable example purchases are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->our WiFi Router<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the pens I use<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the cards in my cameras<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I highly recommend that you check at The Wirecutter before any consumer electronic or personal technology related purchase. Here&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->their guide<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on how to use their site.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had one iPad from every release generation so far.  I ordered the original iPad from the hospital on the day my first son was born.  In many ways, and most of them that count, my iPad is my primary computer at this point.  It travels with me, attends every meeting I attend, and is my constant companion at home.  I read my news feeds on it using the newest generation of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I answer most of the email that I actually answer on it.  It&rsquo;s a work tool, and a personal tool, and, as a result, the yearly release of the new iPads is an assumption of upgrade.</p>
<p>For the last year, I have had two iPads that have seen some amount of use.  An iPad 3, only 18 months or so old at this point, and the iPad Mini, which was purchased/provided by my employer.  As the year went on, I used the iPad 3 less and less.  I love the iPad Mini&rsquo;s weight, despite the obvious tradeoffs that came with, these are well covered on the web already, and old news, I won&rsquo;t cover them here.   When this year&rsquo;s iPads were released, it seemed like a slam dunk that I would wait for the Retina iPad Mini, and that would be the penultimate iPad for me.</p>
<p>Oddly, that&rsquo;s not the way that I went.  I purchased a 64Gb Verizon iPad Air, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with it.  It weighs about what the Mini weighed, and it&rsquo;s just so much better for typing. As I have started using the device more and more as my personal computer, the size of the on screen keyboards touch targets has become important to me, I have meaty brawler hands.  I&rsquo;m sure that I could have been happy with the Mini as well.</p>

<p>Over the last week, first my wife&rsquo;s parents were here, and then mine.  It&rsquo;s one of the most rewarding thing as a parent getting to see your kids interact with your parents.  Unfortunately for us, we live in Georgia, and both sets of grandparents live in New England, so the kids don&rsquo;t get the amount of time with the grandparents that I would like.  I guess the other side of that is that the time they do get to spend with each other is that much more special.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have tried all sorts of methods for managing my day to day, both analog and digital. I&rsquo;d go so far as to call it a never ending process of trial and error, ever trying to find something that works for me, helps me prioritize things the right way, and helps me not forget something important.  Unfortunately, I tend to find a system, use it for some period of time, then decay from using that system back to using my email inbox as my task management system.  I then realize that that doesn&rsquo;t work and I am not prioritizing work the right way, I then try a new system, then begin to decay again after a couple of weeks.  Rarely has any system stuck for very long.</p>
<p>Over the summer, while on a business trip to Manhattan, I read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simplicity Bliss<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about a newish productivity method called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bullet Journal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It struck a chord with me, and so I decided to give it a try for a couple of months and see if it worked for me.  I ran out and picked up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moleskine Evernote Smart Notebook<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, thinking that I would combine this with Evernote for a longer term searchable archive of my daily productivity notes.  This method of managing my todo list, and my notes from the various meetings and calls from each day has proved to work really well for me.  I won&rsquo;t spend any time trying to explain how the system works here, watch the video and head over to the well designed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bullet Journal site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for more information.  What I will say is that I have made some changes in the way that I use the system, and that I still also use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trello<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for managing my longer term to do list, while I use Bullet Journal to manage my day to day to do list and notes from meetings/calls.  I&rsquo;ve filled one of the Evernote notebooks above, and have moved on to my second. That size of notebook works really well for this.  (I am going to experiment with a combination of Bullet Journal and a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hobonichi Techo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the new year.)</p>
<p>I think the reason that this journaling productivity technique works well for me is that it forces a routine each morning, where I am move the undone items from previous days to today&rsquo;s page. This routine makes me think my day through with a more metered approach in mind.  This coupled with the task of physically writing the items down each day engrains the list in my mind as I move through my day.  There&rsquo;s a huge difference for me mentally between typing something and writing it down, and my retention of things I write down seems to be much higher. What I found, after using it for a month or two is that the results in productivity were definitely tangible, and the results in a more peaceful work mind were even more useful.  There will always be change to adapt to in the work day, but it&rsquo;s a lot easier to adapt to change when you have a plan.</p>
<p>The achilles heel of this system, for me anyway, is that my handwriting is not neat, or aesthetically pleasing to me.  I have tried to find <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a better pen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and that helped some.  I am now, however, starting the process of trying to teach myself neater handwriting.  It will end up being one of my New Year&rsquo;s resolutions at the very top of my list.  If there&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t like about yourself, you more than likely can change it, it just takes hard work and mental flexibility.</p>
<p>Basically, I will be using some variant of the Bullet Journal system for the foreseeable future.  It hits the sweet spot for me between the efficiency of my digital toolset and the flexibility and retention of a completely analog system.  Were I using it purely, I don&rsquo;t think it would be as effective for me, it&rsquo;s the hybrid of using it with Trello and Evernote that makes it a success for me.   Huge thanks to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ryder Carrol<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for coming up with this concept and the video/site.</p>

<p>I got a DDC-101 &ldquo;DDC Stuff Sheath&rdquo; because I have been looking for a more flexible cover for my massive and constant usage of Field Notes.  It is, in Draplin&rsquo;s own words &ldquo;Just a simple little leather sheath to protect yer Field Notes, and whatever else your might have in yer pocket.&rdquo;  The simplicity of it made a lot of sense to me, and at $39.99, it didn&rsquo;t seem like too much of a gamble.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that it works much better for me than the cover style Field Notes holders I have used, mainly because it&rsquo;s also a good catch-all for the other things that are knocking around in my pockets.  Mine currently contains a Field Notes notebook, some cash, my frequent shopper card for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Octane<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a printed recipe that I picked up somewhere<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a couple of blank index cards and some Delta airlines coupons for free cocktails.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it every day since it came in the mail, and, if anything, it&rsquo;s getting more attractive looking with continued use. The Stuff Sheath is very well made and durable, and I think I will more than likely get bored of it long before I wear it out or destroy it.  This thing feels like I could end up passing it on to my kids.  Granted, not everyone enjoys the orange, but I do. I find the orange color to be visually striking, and a nice respite from the mostly black gear and covers that I tend to be attracted to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve carried it in both my front and back pockets comfortably, although with a phone in my front pocket, it&rsquo;s a little tight. It&rsquo;s capable of holding quite a bit of stuff, and in my quick testing, the combination of everything I already mentioned plus my passport fit comfortably.</p>
<p>The simplicity and flexibility of this little holder are going to make it a part of my everyday carry for a while.  I recommend it. It seems really simple, because it is.</p>

			 <p>I carry camera gear with me, in my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backpack<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, just about everywhere I go. I&rsquo;ve almost always had a DSLR, a point and shoot, and some kind of phone camera, and I bring some version of this set of gear with me when I go out of town, or out on the town. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s a hard decision on which version of this set of gear I should bring. I mainly use my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sony NEX-7<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I absolutely love as my point and shoot now, but it&rsquo;s too big to fit in my pocket comfortably, meaning that I leave it home when I would sometimes like to bring it.  A lot of the time, I am just carrying my phones, and I take about half the photos I take with my iPhone 5.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by the new Sony <!-- raw HTML omitted -->QX10<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->QX100<!-- raw HTML omitted --> smartphone attachments that are compatible with the iPhone.

			 <p>&ldquo;Well, fuck them, and fuck that.&rdquo; - <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Marco Arment has some great thoughts on the Google Reader shutdown<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been hard for me to be analytical about this shutdown because it made me pretty mad at Google, even though I don&rsquo;t really have a right to be mad. I used Reader for years, and harder than most people who used it daily. I read my stories mainly via the various apps I used to read news hooked to the API, and hardly ever logged on to the web interface. I got a ton of value out of the Google Reader ecosystem over the years, and I never paid even a single dime to Google. (I have paid a fair amount of money to RSS Reader developers over the years, but that&rsquo;s unrelated.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; replacements for the tools I was already using, and I am purposely using a backend rss service that I can pay for. (Feedbin) The crux of the point that Marco makes, that we should keep moving in spite of Google, is an important takeaway. The threat here is bigger than this single shutdown, and Marco actually does a great job of summing it up when he says, &ldquo;Google Reader is just the latest casualty of the war that Facebook started, seemingly accidentally: the battle to own <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everything<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rdquo; The anger I felt as a result of the shutdown was a reaction to having something I value greatly seemingly snatched away for no reason, and having no control over this result. This feeling of lack of control is actually the right motivation to support, as Marco calls it, &ldquo;the antithesis of this new world.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve been working on a new &ldquo;of the week&rdquo; project since the beginning of the year.  At the end of last year, I was tired of taking a picture every day, as much as I enjoyed the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->365 Project<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I didn&rsquo;t want to commit to the same daily level of things this year, partially because of the impending birth of the baby (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->codenamed Smallz<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and partially because I was just tired of being a servant to the project. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
At first, I was thinking that I would try and do a single picture each week, but really work on the technique and quality of each picture.  Then I was thinking that I would do that and start a 365 for the first year of Smallz' life.  (I still plan on doing that.)  When our January issue of Bon Appetit arrived, it had a recipe for a Bahn Mi sandwich that I really was interested in making.  I ended up making it, and taking pictures while doing it.  Making these sandwiches gave me the idea to make something new each week, and learn how to cook and take pictures of food better while doing it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s a collection of the recipes I have made so far<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In the first nine weeks, I have learned that it&rsquo;s not always easy to find something I want to make.  I have also learned that I know far less about cooking than I realized.  A lot of my inspiration so far has come from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Serious Eats<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tasty Kitchen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Both are awesome resources for the home cook.</p>

			 <p>This is more than a test post.  Well, actually, it&rsquo;s a test post because I haven&rsquo;t been able to update this site due to some server problems.  I am working on changing hosting companies.  I need to do this for two reasons, first I am paying way too much for what I am getting with the current hosting company.  Second, I have been updating this site using Blogger since 2001, and Blogger are phasing out support for ftp updating.  So if you aren&rsquo;t hosted on their infrastructure, you really can&rsquo;t use their tools.  This is lame for all manner of reasons, but I think it&rsquo;s the kick in the ass I needed to get this site going again in some meaningful manner.  Current working theory is moving this site and all the other domains associated with it over to Media Temple.  This is time consuming, not because of the moving of files, but because of the moving of all the domains.  It means a lot of phone calls, and I want to make sure that I don&rsquo;t lose them.  So just a test for the moment.</p>

			 <p>So, as I think a lot of people know, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Super Deluxe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is being &ldquo;folded into Adult Swim.&rdquo;    I feel like Super Deluxe was based on a fundamentally good set of ideas.  I also think that we were learning as we went, and had demonstrated a great ability to learn from our audience, and make good decisions from that learning.  However, companies as large as Turner make decisions that they have to make, and they make them based on a variety of reasons, not all of which are apparent or logical to someone outside the decision making process.    I am sure that, for the senior management team, this was the right decision to make, and that&rsquo;s their job.</p>

			 <p>Well, here I am two weeks in.  Still smoke free.  Still very much wanting to smoke.  I can say, with some level of certainty that Chantix is working out very well for me.  It&rsquo;s made life easier than the patch has in the past, and I don&rsquo;t feel medicated either.  Quitting is never going to be easy, no matter what method you use, but the level of discomfort with this method is the least I have had.  As far as side effects go, the only thing I notice is some nausea in the morning after I take the first dose of the day.  I suspect that I would not have this if I ate before taking the pill.</p>

			 <p>Today, I try again, for the fourth time, to quit smoking.  I could talk for a while about the circumstances of my other attempts failing, but in the end I can only blame myself for those failures.  In one case, I stopped smoking for an entire year and relapsed, so I know that I can do the stopping thing with some level of confidence.  This time, I am using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chantix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a pretty new drug from Phizer.  It blocks the receptors that nicotine stimulates to create dopamine, and in turn produces some replacement dopamine of it&rsquo;s own.  I have been taking it for eight days now, and with this method of quitting, you smoke for the first week.  Meanwhile the Chantix is making the nicotine absorbtion go down more every day.  So in a sense, you are dealing with the physical side of the addiction while you are still smoking.  After taking it for a week, you stop smoking, and today is that day for me.  Yesterday, my smokes tasted awful and offered none of the satisfaction they used to, which means the Chantix is working.</p>

One of the best things about visiting Manhattan is getting to do a little shopping, and this recent trip is no exception.  I walked around SoHo for a few hours last Monday, and walked into the Camper store.  I had previously worn Campers, but as their lines of shoes changed, I stopped.  Happily, on this trip, their newest line had some really awesome new shoes in it, and I picked up a pair <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of these<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  After having worn them for a few days, I have to say that they are one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I have ever owned.</p>

			 <p>I spent the last ten days in New England, mainly for the purpose of fulfilling my role as the best man in my brother Chris' wedding.  I come back somewhat exhausted, and after fighting through some parking snafus at Atlanta Hartsfield, am finally sitting in my office at home, waiting for Zifty.com to bring me some dinner.  It was a great week away.  Spending time with my family always puts things in perspective for me the way nothing else in my life can.</p>

			 <p>Comcast, we&rsquo;ve been together for Internet access for almost three years now, but I am having second thoughts about our future together.  My service has not gone a week without failing in some way for the last three months.  You make appointments with me, then show up at the wrong time, sometimes not at all, or you call to cancel at the very end of my three hour appointment window.  When you do show up, your technicians are unable to figure out what is wrong with my service.  Your technical support people put me on hold so long that my battery in my phone dies while on hold.  If I had a choice in the matter, I would have broken up with you months ago.</p>

			 <p>Blizzard released patch 1.9 for World of Warcraft yesterday.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Something Awful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has great, and funny patch notes commentary.  My guild went into ZG, one of the mid-level endgame instances, last night, and discovered that the patch introduced some new bugs.  These large trash mobs, Beserkers, fear after a certain amount of time into the encounter.  Last night, this fear caused some large percentage of the party to crash, which was annoying and caused one wipe.  Additionally, it seemed that a couple of the ZG bosses were buffed while others were made easier. (Tiger Boss for one.)  Finally, Hakkar, the end boss, which was a pretty easy encounter for us previously, proved to be very difficult.  I am not sure if this was a bug of some sort, or he was buffed.  Overall, my patch experience was a negative one, which has pretty much been the norm with Blizzard.  I hate that all my UI add ons stop working too, and I wish they would foster a better relationship with add on developers.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty quiet here the last few months.  I think this hiatus of sorts is over now, for a variety of reasons.  One of them, however, is that I have accepted a new position working on a new project within Turner.  I am no longer the lead technologist for PGA.com.  The new position is exciting, and a bit scary in its proportions, but I am not allowed to discuss it in this forum.  PGA.com was a great experience for me, three years filled with challenges, working with and for some great people, and learning a whole lot about golf and golf scoring.  I think my final count was seven different golf scoring systems written from scratch.   When the Masters approaches this Spring, I will feel a tinge of nostalgia.</p>

Anyway, that&rsquo;s not the point of this post.  I have been going to the same stylist for the last four years.  Before that I had this amazing Japanese woman who cut my hair. She cut my hair for two years before sadly moving to New York.  Well, she didn&rsquo;t move to New York sadly, I was sad that she moved.  Now, four years later, I called to make an appointment to groom my shaggy hairstyle, and they informed me that my stylist no longer worked out of that salon.</p>

I confess that I too love this video game, perhaps a little more than I should.  I have played this game more than any other game I have ever played over the last eight months.  Lately, I have realized that I need to tone it down a bit, as I have been dedicating many nights to playing the game that I used to dedicate to other things.  This should take care of itself with the start of two softball leagues this week and the advent of the super busy season at work.</p>

			 <p>Well, a 24 hour site outage that started early Monday morning came to end last night.  Over the last day, lots of ideas and opinions about Apple deciding to switch to Intel chips over the next two years.  It&rsquo;s one of those concepts that is hard for you to wrap your head around and feel like you have a good understanding of how things may play out.  My personal analysis keeps getting interrupted by &ldquo;I wonders.&rdquo;  So much of how this affects the marketplace and Apple itself depends on decisions they will make as they make the transition.  In reading other people&rsquo;s opinions, I try and keep in mind that people generally are not fond of change.  Gizmodo has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a little roundup of stories around the Web<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that is a good starting point for further reading.</p>

			 <p>As usual, the slow posting pace here equates with busy time in my offline life.  My parents visited two weekends ago.  Naturally, it was a fun visit, as my parents are fun to be around, and I think we enjoy each other&rsquo;s company now more than we ever have.  The pacing of the visit this year was different from the pacing last year, as they had visited before, and seen the house, and so there was less to show them for the first time.  I also think they had been keeping a hectic schedule in Florida, where they were for a month previous to their visit with me.   We shared a lovely day at the BellSouth Classic, the local PGA Tour golf tournament, and I managed to get a severe sunburn in the process.  The sunburn is, of course, gone now, and it went from painful to peeling and has now settled into a light tan.  I doubt that I will be enhancing the tan this weekend, as I am feeling the sinus effects of the pollen attack on our city that occurs every Spring.</p>

			 <p>Well the patch to World of Warcraft, or WoW, that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I previously blogged about<!-- raw HTML omitted --> got applied to the servers yesterday.  What a mess.  Blizzard must not have an effective test methodology for patches and patch rollouts.  It took hours for them to get the servers back up, and there were other issues that caused them to have to reboot servers after they brought them back up.  On the realms that did come back up, one could see hundreds of new characters from everyone who was displaced because their realms were still down.  Once I got back in, the new features were nice, espeically the new toolbars.  The general feeling among the community is that Blizzard does not care about our horrible in game experiences and server experiences.  I think, if they were to put their money where their mouths are, they would refund everyone playing some percentage of their monthly fee for the downtime and frustration.</p>

I have probably turned ten or fifteen people onto that one book, and have never gotten a single bad response from the person.  Almost everyone has gone on the read the entire series.</p>

			 <p>I love <!-- raw HTML omitted -->March Madness<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  This afternoon the whole thing kicks off, and I am ready, bracket in hand.  This year, my bracket is very different from the ones that my co-workers have filled out.  This makes me a little nervous, but I am also here in the heart of ACC Basketball fandom.  Being a New England boy at heart, I tend to favor the Big East.  It always feels to me like the media overvalues the big name ACC teams.  My final four includes Florida, Louisville, Oklahoma St. and Syracuse.  I am probably less confident with these picks than any in the last five or six years, but I also feel like parity in the NCAA has made it much harder to make the picks.  I also have not followed hoops as faithfully as I have in year&rsquo;s past.  Finally, go UCONN!!</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> I finally got around to seeing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> last night, renting it for 4 dollars on my Comcast&rsquo;s in demand service, which I am rapidly becoming addicted to.  It&rsquo;s a funny, witty movie that contains many in jokes if you can look beyond the Cheech and Chong veneer that it is wrapped in, which is juvenile and sophomoric at its worst.  It&rsquo;s one of those movies that crammed a lot of things and subplot lines into a regular sized movie, yet it doesn&rsquo;t feel rushed or overly crammed.  Naturally, it is one of those movies that will appeal more to men than women, and probably men in the demographic age-wise of early thirties down to teens.  I went into it with medium sized expectations, one of my co-workers sang it high praises, despite the fact that he doesn&rsquo;t like most of the comedies that I love, including Seinfeld and Napolean Dynamite, to name two, this one hit the mark squarely.  I recommend it as a guilty pleasure movie on a weekend night in, or on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Warning, it may make you crave a White Castle burger, and that may be problematic in many parts of the country.</p>

Of course, tickets go on sale tomorrow, so there is that one smallish detail to be covered.  Last year, it was a great experience, and, based on this year&rsquo;s lineup, I have great expectations for this year&rsquo;s version.  I&rsquo;m especially looking forward to seeing Weezer, Wilco, Boom Bip, and Jamie Cullum because I have never seen them live before.  Notable standouts from last year returning include indie darling Bright Eyes, and Sage Francis, who was my second favorite performance to the innovative and inventive set from Dangermouse.  Of course, I am also a longtime fan of Nine Inch Nails, and have seen them several times, including the first Lollapalooza.</p>

			 <p>I know I&rsquo;m a little late to the party, but I finally watched <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Garden State<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday.  It&rsquo;s a little amusing to me that I hadn&rsquo;t seen it yet considering how many times I have listened to the soundtrack over the last six months.  Being so familiar with the soundtrack, and then experiencing the music in the context of the film, was an interesting experiment in expectations.  For the most part, whomever choose the music for the film seemed to have a very personal relationship with the music they chose, and it matched the movie very well.  As far as the film goes, it wouldn&rsquo;t be going too far to say that this film is my favorite one that came out in 2004, with the caveat that I haven&rsquo;t seen too many films.  As a total work, I really feel like this movie didn&rsquo;t fall short anywhere.  The writing was fantastic, the visual feel of the movie was enormous, and the characters were well conceived.  The use of wide lenses added a depth to the movie visually that made me want to print each frame out and hang it on a wall somewhere.  I think this movie could have been set in any suburban sprawlish area, and I think most people in their twenties and thirties can relate to both the characters and the bogger theme of sorting things out in the transition to the &ldquo;real world.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Penny Arcade interviews Blizzard about World of Warcraft<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The game has been successful at an astounding clip, and I think you have to try it to really understand why.  It&rsquo;s like no other game that I have ever played in terms of depth, richness, and sheer size.  Despite all the press that the problems are gigantic, I have really not run into too many issues on the server I play on.  (Bloodhoof)  It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the issues of scale are solved, and those issues seem to be caused by the fact that they have sold the game at more than twice the upper threshold they expected.  All I know is that I have really enjoyed it so far, and that the features they are planning on adding are exciting.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our Atlanta Falcons<!-- raw HTML omitted --> didn&rsquo;t fare so well against a well coached Philadelphia squad today.  Hats off to Philly, and their fans, who have waited long enough for this moment.  The game wasn&rsquo;t filled with huge plays, the Eagles out performed the Falcons on almost every level.  The Falcons defense played a great game, but the offense seemed out of kilter throughout the game.  If nothing else, this game was an excellent demonstration of the type of quarterback that Michael Vick could become with good maturation in Donovan McNabb.  He played a fantastic game, ran when he had to, passed well, and made good decisions.  Mr. Vick was harried by the Eagles defense throughout the game, and never really got it going.  For next year, I would like to see more wide receiver talent here in Atlanta, as I think that would make a big difference.  Right now, the Pats are dominating the Steelers, so the dream of an all Pennsylvania Super Bowl is unlikely.</p>

			 <p>If you care, I apologize for the dearth of posts over the last couple of months.  It started when I went to Hawaii, which was a great experience in every possible way, and carried through the holidays into the New Year.  For whatever reason, I just haven&rsquo;t been feeling like spending a lot of time in front of the computer.  In the New Year, I have been concentrating on getting some things in order, and watching football, and playing some World of Warcraft.  Posting will resume now.  Lots to catch up on, new camera that I have been spending a lot of time using, somewhat of a revised outlook on life, and a lot of optimism about my future as a person.  Corners have been turned here in Atlanta, some of which are long overdue.</p>

			 <p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Atlanta Falcons<!-- raw HTML omitted --> handed the St. Louis Rams an ass whooping last night.  All I can say is that, in the years I have lived here in Atlanta, I have never, ever, seen so many people so enthusiastic about the Falcons.  Last night, we had to go to a second sports bar to find a table, and we were lucky to even get a table at the second bar.  The Falcons franchise, and Arthur Blank, the owner, deserve a ton of credit.  Blank has made the right decisions at the right time over the last couple of years, and didn&rsquo;t make rash decisions when originally purchasing the team.  His patience is now paying off.  For a town that is really a football town, we have at least a couple of years of this level of success to look froward to.  Go Falcons!!</p>

I did similar research this summer, when hanging out with someone on a sporadic basis who said this same thing on a regular basis when I was with her.  Truth of the matter, when looking at actual budget numbers, is that Democrats don&rsquo;t necessarily spend less, or have less of a committment to defense spending, than Republicans.  Having said that, this is not the issue I usually have with the Democrats, it&rsquo;s fiscal responsibility.  Oddly, they have turned the tables on that as well in recent years.</p>

Panic has decided to retire Audion, a great little music player, which had much similarity to a version of WinAMP for the Mac OS, for those of you unfamiliar with it.  This article is a great behind the scenes look at independent software development in the Mac OS market.  It is also an interesting look into this particular market segment, and the things that happened behind the scenes.  Apple wanted to buy Audion at least twice, and AOL also tried at one point.  Finally, this article reveals something that those of us using their software already knew, that the guys at Panic are truly great guys, and that they do what they do for all the right reasons.  If you are a Mac user, they are offering Audion as a free download.  I own a license, bought before the iTunes Music Store, and I haven&rsquo;t had the app installed on my machine in a while.</p>

			 <p>So, I arrived in New Orleans (nola) this afternoon.  Everything so far has been a little bit off kilter.  First, my room wasn&rsquo;t ready and I had to wait in the Executive Lounge for an hour before they had my room ready.  Instead of a non-smoking room, which is what I asked for, I got a smoking room with the ash trays removed.  This place smells awful.  There is an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everquest Convention<!-- raw HTML omitted --> going on in the hotel I am making my temporary home.  As a result, there are some odd looking folks, even odder than your normal computer convention crew, wandering the halls.  In addition, the hotel&rsquo;s in-room Internet service is being rendered downright unusable.  I can only surmise that the bandwidth is being sucked up with hundreds of Everquest sessions going on, but doing anything even slightly Broadbandish is brutally slow.  The result will be that any picture posting may have to wait until either their convention ends, or I can get to a faster, less logjammed connection.</p>

Lots of useful new features in this release, but probably the most interesting one they have revealed in these pages is Sourceless Deployment, which lets you distribute compiled Java bytecode versions of your applications.  There are, of course, others, which I wish I could talk about, because they will allow App Developers to do things with ColdFusion/Java that just weren&rsquo;t posssible before.</p>

			 <p>Well, clearly I should not have waited until today to advance vote.  I arrived at the polling place at 7:30 am, half an hour after they opened the doors, to find a line of about 2500 people.  I waited, with my seven new line friends, for six hours before I got to actually vote.  The polling folks were very clearly unprepared for the turnout, with only 16 booths.  I whipped through the touch screen voting process in about thirty seconds.  I have now fulfilled my responsibility, and will now become a spectator.  When I left the polling place around 1:30 pm, the line was longer than when I got there.  (The polls also close at 7 pm, so if you do the math, some of those people are going to get shut out.)  My feet hurt.  Oh, and I don&rsquo;t care who you vote for, but please vote.  It&rsquo;s a responsibility in addition to being a right.  If I can wait in line six hours to make sure my ballot is cast, you can also take time to cast yours.</p>

			 <p>Things around the office have been really crazy this last couple of weeks for a variety of reasons.  Reason number one is that it seems like tasks swell to whatever the current amount of available time is plus ten percent.  Reason number two is that I am leaving town on Saturday and need to find a few hours before I leave to take advantage of Georgia&rsquo;s new advance voting while still finishing out all of my team&rsquo;s projects.  Reason number three is that our office culture is one hundred eighty degrees opposed to one that fosters good development and specification processes. Features change, features are dropped, features are added, and while I do my best to keep things in check, I inevitably could do better. (That&rsquo;s one that I have had to struggle with for the last 22 months, so I am not sure that it really counts.)  Unfortunately, this means that I end up leaning rather heavily on those around me for support.  We&rsquo;ll see how this turns out, but Friday will, without a doubt, be a very interesting day.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bob Barr: &ldquo;An agonizing choice&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I feel that he hit the nail right on the head with this article.  In fact, this may be the first time ever that I have agreed with Bob Barr.  For me, the hot button issue is the lack of fiscal conservatism.  The fact that the rise in nondefense discretionary spending has been unprecedented under this president, with a Republican controlled Congress, is unacceptable.  Couple this with the tax cut, and you have a recipe for fiscal disaster.  I fundamentally do not understand what the thinking behind this could be.  I&rsquo;ve also had several people, some of them really smart folks, try to explain what they think the reasoning is.  In every case the explanations have had massive holes in them.  There is no excuse for this.  It&rsquo;s nice to see someone not afraid to express their opinion, even if it goes against their party, because the facts and situation dictates it.</p>

			 <p>I just finished reading Nick Sagan&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->idlewild<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  A very good first novel, in my opinion, certainly heavily influenced by some of his father&rsquo;s works.(He is Carl Sagan&rsquo;s son.)  It felt similar, in some ways, to Zelazny&rsquo;s Amber Chronicles in terms of some of the storyline, and the type and structure of the characters.  It however, is nothing like those books in terms of the place and time in which it occurs.  The tone of the book was striking to me, and I look forward to digging into Edenborn, the sequel almost immediately, that is as soon as I finish watching the Yankees.  If you are a fan of science fiction, I think this book is a must read.  I think that Nick Sagan may be one of the best new voices in this genre over the last few years.</p>

I subscribed for two reasons.  The first is that this is a Web application that I actually use and have used more, not less in the months since I joined.  The combination of social network with photography is perfect because, at least for me, pictures tend to be a very social thing.  Secondly, it is one of the best Web applications I have ever used, and I want to encourage the team that built it to build more stuff because I think that I will like the new stuff they might build  just as much.  Over the time I have been using Flickr, they have been constantly adding and rethinking things, and the result is an evolving elegant application.</p>

At home, I have the four or five spent ones on a bookshelf, and although I rarely refer back to them now, I foresee a time when I will do so fondly.  I prefer the ones filled with graph paper, perhaps a throwback to my geekier youth.

			 <p>Monday night, I decided to see how difficult it would be to create a ColdFusion Language Module for BBEdit using the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->codeless language module feature of BBEdit 8<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I&rsquo;ve wanted solid syntax coloring for ColdFusion docs in BBEdit virtually forever, and undertook this project one time before only to run up against a brick wall (previously, language modules had to be written in C.)  As far as I know, with the exception of the UI painful Eclipse and JEdit, the only option on the Mac OS X platform with real ColdFusion syntax coloring is Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver on Mac OS X is painfully slow to use, gets in my way constantly, and deserves, in my opinion, to be rewritten from the ground up.  I don&rsquo;t say this lightly, but then again, I do feel that virtually all the code I&rsquo;ve ever written needs to be rewritten from the ground up.</p>

			 <p>On the plane, I read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wisdom Of Forgiveness: Intimate Conversations and Journeys<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a book about forgiveness authored by Victor Chan and His Holiness the Dalai Lama.  It&rsquo;s the second book about forgiveness that I have read this summer, and I definitely enjoyed it as much as the other works I have read that involved the Dalai Lama.  Victor Chan added a very personal set of insights into the way Tibetan Buddhism views and deals with forgiveness, and that made this book that much more special to me.  This personal touch never felt contrived, this man is a friend of the Lama, and his interaction with His Holiness seems to be a special one.  I think that anyone, regardless of religous conviction or beliefs, will take something very moving and changing from this book.  Forgiveness is something that I seem to struggle with greatly at times, and the interdependent nature of our relationships with the people and world around us is something that I need to think about more when conducting my daily affairs.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I spent the weekend in Dallas where my good friend Steve Isenburg got married to a beautiful and engaging woman, Amanda Wilson.  Steve was one of the first real friends I met when I moved down to Atlanta from New York, and I&rsquo;ve missed his company since he and Amanda moved down to Fort Worth. We had quite a few small adventures together, including an ill fated attempt by me to do some white water canoeing with him. It was great to see the two of them tie the knot, and to do so in front of two amazing families and numerous friends.  One of the real treats of the weekend for me was to get to spend time with Steve&rsquo;s dad.  All I can say is that I wish them the best possible life together, they are two genuinely great people.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For several months, I have been using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniOutliner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to keep track of my multitude of simultaneous projects, and iCal to manage the daily to-do items that I have with due dates.  Earlier this week, a few different blogs noted the release of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Process<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an outliner for Mac OS X designed specifically for project management purposes.  I&rsquo;ve spent the last couple of days getting used to it, and I&rsquo;m now totally sold on it as a replacement for the Omni/iCal combo.  It adds a few features that make a big difference to me for the purposes of project management, aside from the obvious ability to use one application where I currently use two.  First, the ability to color label individual items makes my gigantic to-do list much easier to read.  Secondly, I was just thinking last week that I would like it very much if OmniOutliner supported a tabbed interface, and the &ldquo;Projects&rdquo; that Process handles are a perfect substitute.  I can also prioritize each item, and assign it a to-do alarm.  These alarms aren&rsquo;t limited to your run of the mill alert message and sound.  They can be an alert, automatically open a fill or application, play a sound, or even execute a unix command.  Finally, the application allows you to link specific tasks to files in the filesystem, making it easy to remember where that specification or diagram is currently located.  Process fits nicely into the way I work, and the way that my mind breaks up projects.  I recommend checking it out if you already use an outliner of some sort for project management.</p>

			 <p>It seems lately, that this has turned into a Yankees blog.  Today marks the 25th anniversary of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thurman Munson&rsquo;s death<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  For those of you who wouldn&rsquo;t know, Thurman Munson was the catcher for the Yankees in the Seventies.  He was a remarkable player.   On a team full of leaders and veterans, he was the captain, an honor that might mean more on the Yankees than any other professional sports franchise. (Derek Jeter is the current captain.)  I can remember the day, twenty five years ago, when my father walked in the side door of our house, and announced that Thurman Munson had died in a plane crash.  At first I thought he was kidding, our family has this odd sense of humor, and I thought he was pulling my leg.  It, however, was true, and I was crushed.  So, today I remember him fondly, a hero of my youth, a quiet, humble man, despite his myriad of onfield achievements.  Today, his locker still sits empty at Yankee Stadium.</p>

			 <p>So, the Yankees traded Mr. Unreliable, Jose Contreras, for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Esteban Loaiza<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in essence getting reliability but trading a player with four years left on his contract for one who is a free agent at the end of the season.  I think it&rsquo;s a fantastic, and unexpected move, and it should shore the starting rotation up going into the stretch run.  The moral of the story is that the Yankees want to win it all this year, and are willing to continue to mortgage the future to do it.  In many ways, this was a better, smarter deal than any one involving Randy Johnson would have been.  Kudos to Mr. Cashman.</p>

			 <p>After this week&rsquo;s DNC, and a lot of soul searching, I am quite close to making a decision about who to support in this year&rsquo;s election.  For a moderate, it&rsquo;s not the easy clear cut decision that it is for the Dems and Pubs in the house.  Interestingly, in my case, it seems like the places where the current administration has chosen to get more conservative are almost universally where my hot button issues are.  I don&rsquo;t see, however, how I could possibly make my mind up before the RNC.  Another thing, after watching about 25 hours of DNC coverage this week, mostly on Fox News, I can say without hesitation that I have little or no interest in ever being credentialed and attending the conventions.  It&rsquo;s like a four day infomercial.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gothamist: New Yankee Stadium Is In The Works<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  I have very mixed feelings about this.  It&rsquo;s a shame that the older parks, with only a couple of exceptions, are being phased out.  I&rsquo;m happy that I have gotten to see as many games at the current Yankee stadium as I have seen.  Thinking about Ruth, Mantle, Dimaggio, Gehrig, Maris, Berra, and all the others playing on that same field makes the place seem magical.  I was just up there, and saw a game about three weeks ago.  The stadium is not as nice as the modern facilities, like Turner Field here in Atlanta.  Turner Field gives you ample opportunity to spend more money, and I would guess that would be part of the reason for a newer, yet smaller, Yankee Stadium.  More luxury boxes mean more revenue.  What is going to happen with Monument Park?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been watching the FNC coverage of the DNC last night and tonight.  The theory being that I will hear the most critical voice possible from Fox News, since they are terribly biased, not towards true conservatism, but towards the Republican party.  Listening to the comments after Theresa Heinz Kerry&rsquo;s speech tonight, I feel somewhat bad for Fox because they came off seeming quite ignorant with their analysis after her speech.  One of their analysts could not resist the temptation to make comments that had a distinct xenophobic tone, primarily referring to her accent.  Barack Obama definitely stole the show this evening.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m sure a lot of Miami Dolphin fans are positively reeling from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ricky William&rsquo;s unexpected retirement<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The article I linked to, sort of a summary piece, does a good job of creating some perspective.  He doesn&rsquo;t love the game of football, and certainly doesn&rsquo;t love being a celebrity the way people would expect him to love it.  Football has been very financially good to him, and he really doesn&rsquo;t need to play more seasons.  I&rsquo;ve read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sporadically, and was always impressed with his perspective.  If he has other interests, and doesn&rsquo;t really have his heart in football, good for him.  It had to be a very difficult decision to make.  Professional football is an incredibly dangerous career, and the position of running back is an especially brutal one to play.  Did he have a responsibility to the city of Miami and to the Dolphins?  I would be upset if the key player on one of my teams just up and quit like this, and there are definitely better ways of dealing with things.  On the other hand, his first responsibility is to himself.</p>

			 <p>After seeing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Tivoli PAL on Kevin Kelly&rsquo;s Cool Tools site, I purchased an &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPAL<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; (the one that matches my iPod in color).  It has totally lived up to my expectations, being the perfect bedroom companion to my iPod.  It&rsquo;s nice because it takes up very little space on my nightstand, but still has fantastic sound within the volume range I want when I am in bed or getting ready to go somewhere.  The bonus is the built-in radio, which I have found myself using more than I thought I would.  I haven&rsquo;t used the battery to take it elsewhere, but I could see taking it to the pool, or using it in a hotel room on the road since it is fairly small.  If you are looking for a small speaker output for your iPod, this item may very well be the perfect item to fill your need.</p>

Of course, since I already have a 40 GB 3g model, I&rsquo;m more interested in finding out if they plan on updating the OS on my iPod to add the new menu functionality we can see on the 4g models.  They have previously not updated the OS on earlier models when they went from 2g to 3g, but there were a lot fewer iPods then than there are now.  It&rsquo;s an operating system, and we deserve operating system updates, within reason for our hardware, in my opinion, for our investment.

			 <p>I&rsquo;m thinking about having a community contest to design a new logo/identity for bump.  Despite my best efforts and intentions, I am not a designer, and the sheer amount of effort and practice to make myself better at graphic design is just not something that I can invest in right now.  I have a 2nd generation, 20Gb iPod that I am not using anymore, and haven&rsquo;t sold yet.  Do you folks think that it would be enough of a prize to inspire good entries?  Is the &ldquo;iPod as a contest prize&rdquo; thing being done so much right now that people don&rsquo;t even care anymore?  What would be a better, but reasonable prize for such a contest?  Am I better off just hiring qualified folks to do it for me?  I mean this is a personal site, and I do already spend my hard earned money for the priviledge of having it.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Introducing Brady – The Macromedia IDE for Flex<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Looks, based on the screenshots, like it is based on the Dreamweaver codebase.  I tried switching to Dreamweaver for my ColdFusion development on my Mac OS X machines, but it just gets in my way.  I love the lean fast feeling of a text editor like BBEdit or Homesite.  I continue to maintain that Macromedia would be well served to continue to develop Homesite.  It&rsquo;s a shame that, aside from Eclipse and the forthcoming E3, that there isn&rsquo;t a lean text editor on the Mac OS X platform that supports syntax highlighting for ColdFusion.  I looked into creating said syntax coloring for BBEdit, and was turned off by the now ancient method of creating said modules.</p>

Well, it is quite clear we are getting close to launch, and that Google has started handing out a lot more invites.

People, in the end, just want what they can&rsquo;t have, even if what they can&rsquo;t have isn&rsquo;t heads and shoulders better than other similar products on the market.</p>

I found the studio to be a warm, friendly, inviting environment, and reasonably priced.

I think that this is typical Microsoft.  Announce really early, too early, and announce with ridiculous statements.  A fifty dollar music player with iPod level storage and features?  Not possible.  It&rsquo;s a typical tactic to cast doubts and fear on the marketplace.  Good old MSFT, we can always count on her for the same tactics.  Prediction:  Their music service will suck ass.  Their players will suck too, or at least not be as good as the iPod.  They will lose tons of money trying to establish themselves, and attempt to leverage Windows to get more traction.  In the end, they won&rsquo;t be successful for the same reasons that Apple won&rsquo;t.  The labels control the industry, and they won&rsquo;t let some distributor, no matter how big the company is, into their little piece of turf.</p>

It&rsquo;s more of a book of observations about forgiveness, its nature, its role in our lives, and attaining the balance to live with it, than a how-to guide of some sort.  These sorts of books seem to be more effective for people of my nature.  There is a chapter of the book up on his site if you want to give it a test drive.  I really enjoyed the book, and I think it had a good impact on me.  It remains to be seen whether that impact is fleeting or if I can make more meaningful change in my demeanor.</p>

			 <p>Well, last week saw the launch of a new set of software that I wrote, and this software was a substantially refactored version of some software that I wrote last year.  I, apparently, was much dumber last year, because I am generating the same result with my software as the set of components I wrote a year ago, but the new version is something like 2200 lines of code shorter.  Anyway, I spent a good chunk of my weekend overseeing the live burn-in of that software, fixing some minor bugs that cropped up, and generating a punchlist for some improvements.  All fun, and fun to cross a big project off my to do list.</p>

			 <p>There have been quite a few sites yesterday and today linking to this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sacramento Bee interview<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with an ex-Marine who was in Iraq.

I could find no reference at all to a cluster bomb by this name.  I sent an email off to the reporter who did the interview last night but haven&rsquo;t heard back yet.  Am I wrong?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here is one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the several comprehensive listings of American cluster armaments that I found online.

I, however, am thinking about choosing about 200 disks that I really want ripped and sending them off.  It would probably take me a weekend to rip 200 disks myself, adding the time it takes to check the meta-data that the CDDB returns, which, for a lot of the stuff I listen to, is somewhat wrong.  Anyone used either of these services, or know of any that are better?  Let me know in the comments, I guess.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian Unlimited has an interview with Evan<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one of the founders of Blogger.   It&rsquo;s the first place where I have seen someone from Blogger actually comment on their stand on syndication.  He says, &ldquo;We went with Atom feeds for everybody - they&rsquo;re on new blogs by default - because of the ease of use and simplicity.&rdquo;  I mean, it is Google&rsquo;s software, and it is their decision to make, but I think that introducing Atom into the equation makes it more confusing.  Even today, on a mailing list of some fairly technology savvy people that I am on, someone asked the RSS vs. Atom question, and I grimaced.  If the best argument for going with Atom as a Syndication format is ease of use and simplicity, then they don&rsquo;t really have a decent argument for not offering both and making Atom the default.  This just makes them look ridiculous and bitchy to me.   (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->via<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</p>

			 <p>In an effort to go completely overboard with Blogger relaunch stuff and get it out of my system, I now link to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogger&rsquo;s RSS Decision: Atom Only<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I completely agree with Dan about this. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that Blogger&rsquo;s claim, that different XML syndication formats are problematic for their application, is a load of crap.  Forget for a moment the server farm argument that Dan presents in his opinion piece, and consider how Blogger works at a core level.  They take post information, which is stored in a relational database, and then push that information through a publishing engine, which grabs your custom template and pushes your structured post information into that template in pre-defined locations.  So they are already storing millions of different output formats (everyone&rsquo;s templates), and publishing information through all of them, but they can&rsquo;t support two xml outputs at the same time?  If this is the case, they might want to revisit their application architecture.  If you have an argument against something technical, present that argument, but don&rsquo;t raise some fud argument that any reasonable, semi-technical person can see through.   As a former Pro user, I can still publish good old rss.  However, I cannot publish both RSS and Atom at the same time, and this irks me.</p>

			 <p>After ten weeks of wearing nicotine patches and managing to remain smoke free, today marks the beginning of my &ldquo;flying without a net,&rdquo; so to speak.  I&rsquo;m ready for it, and I am going to make it this time.  As far as the effects of being smoke free, I feel much better.  Not that it has been easy, it hasn&rsquo;t.  I&rsquo;ve gained a few pounds, and I&rsquo;m not happy about that aspect of my cessation.</p>

			 <p>Dan Gillmor: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How a Nation Forfeits its Meaning<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I feel like plausible deniability is being asserted by the administration, and it is the same kind of slickness that the same group of neo-conservatives who are now such staunch supporters of GW complained about during the Clinton administration.  The difference this time is that peoples lives, and everything our country stands for, are at risk. Bush and Rumsfeld are in charge, and, if they are not, then shame on them for that instead and in addition to these atrocities.  I can&rsquo;t believe that people are not more outraged by this whole incident.  It goes against the very moral core of this country to do stuff like this.  I&rsquo;m embarrassed, frankly, and I would like to see the people responsible for this be punished severely to send a message.  As this year goes on, the Bush administration continues to do a fantastic job of driving moderates like myself towards the other party.    Mistakes happen, but it&rsquo;s the slick nature of their response to mistakes that leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

			 <p>Well, it has been seven weeks since my last cigarette.  I&rsquo;ve executed on my game plan almost perfectly so far.  I knew in advance how hard it would be, but until you are actually in the withdrawal symptoms, it is difficult to gauge just how hard they are to cope with.  I accidentally went down a stage in the patch system two weeks early, and that may be what is causing some of my current discomfort, but I only have one more week of patches left.  I will be very happy when this discomfort stage is over, and I am already feeling much better than I was a couple of weeks ago.  I&rsquo;ve managed, so far, to keep my weight gain to a minimum.

			 <p>I stepped down to the second stage nicotine patch yesterday, cutting my daily dosage of nicotine by one third in the process.  This morning, I thought it would be interesting to gauge how severe my physical addiction is by attempting to not wear a patch at all.  I  got into the office on time, and we had a network issue that sucked up the first two hours of my day.  During that time, I became grumpy, irritable, and even went so far as to snap on a couple of co-workers.  Needless to say, I put the patch on almost immediately after that, and felt my grumpiness disappear.  The moral of the story is that I have some ground to cover before I have the physical addiciton kicked.  Still, I feel so much better.  My breathing is clear, I can taste my food, and I am kicking it in the gym like I haven&rsquo;t since college.</p>

			 <p>I had quite a good weekend, Spring is here in Atlanta, and we&rsquo;re making the most of it.  I&rsquo;m still smoke free, one week in and it is starting to get easier.  I&rsquo;ve had a lot of support from my family and friends, and that&rsquo;s made a huge difference.  My fears about going out to bars were confirmed, but since the weather was so nice, we managed to stay outside on patios, which helped substantially.  Yesterday, I went and bought a set of golf clubs for this season.  I managed to buy everything except for the putter used, and that saved me a lot of money.  Now I just have to get out there and start improving.</p>

			 <p>Well, I&rsquo;ve made it to Friday smoke free.  It has been pretty rough at times, but I feel really peaceful about things right now.  My moodiness hasn&rsquo;t been nearly as bad I remember it being during previous quit attempts.  I&rsquo;m chalking that up to a combination of my emotional maturity level being higher, and the fact that I am more hard nosed in terms of my quitting mental state.  I think the first time that I quit, when I made it a full year before relapsing, I was equally as positive about my desire to quit.  The relapse was a moment of mental weakness involving alcohol, and I&rsquo;ve decided that, instead of avoiding social drinking situations as I did when I quit that time, I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and put myself in those situations throughout the quitting process because I think that will help me to develop the mental hardness necessary to stay quit months from now.  I&rsquo;m still a bit scared of being in those situations over the next few weeks, this weekend should be an interesting study in how strong my desire is.</p>

			 <p>Day two was much worse than day one.  The cravings were pretty bad during the day at work.  I went to see the Lakers play the Hawks last night.  We had a couple of beers during the game, which didn&rsquo;t seem to make matters worse, which is surprising to me.  Afterwards a nice late supper at a local brewpub, where I ran into an old friend I hadn&rsquo;t seen in years.  It was a nice night.  The cravings got much worse at the end of the night, and I felt relieved to wake up this morning knowing that I weathered the storm.  Usually, day three has been the worst day for me when quitting, but so far, it hasn&rsquo;t been that bad.  We&rsquo;ll see as the afternoon wears on.  I&rsquo;ve been working very hard to adapt my mental toolset to deal with the mindgames necessary to convince myself that the cravings will subside.</p>

That isn&rsquo;t to say that it was pleasant, far from it.  For the most part, the patch sheltered me from the serious physical cravings, so I just had to deal with the mental addiction.  At work, where I am on the tenth floor, things went smoothly. I had a headache for a good chunk of the afternoon, and I pushed through the cravings as they presented themselves.  When I went home, things got a little rougher, mainly because going out back for a cigarette is such a regualr part of my routine.  Day two has been a little worse so far, and I am hoping to stay busy.</p>

The first couple of days are usually difficult, but the third day for me has always seemed to be the worst, so I am bracing myself for Wednesday&rsquo;s bloodbath.  I am wearing the patch again, my most successful attempt to date was with using the patch, and I did make it a full year before relapsing.  I&rsquo;ll blog more about this later, but so far things have been just mildly uncomfortable.  I may try to work more hours this week in order to shield myself from temptation.</p>

			 <p>I got a chance today to inspect the iPod mini at the Atlanta Apple Store.  It was even smaller than I thought it would be.  For me, it wouldn&rsquo;t really fill a practical place in my tech arsenal, I already have a 40 Gb regular iPod.  I was, however, impressed with it.  Afterwards, out of curiousity, I took a run over to my local CompUSA to look at the other music players that are in the same price/size class.  There are larger players that are quite a bit bigger, have more storage, and are only a bit more than the mini, but there really aren&rsquo;t any other players that are in the same class in terms of the overall size and storage capacity of the device.  It feels well made, and somehow more durable than the other small players.  The controls and display are what I have come to expect from Apple&rsquo;s music players, usable and readable, and this is one area where many of their competitors have constantly fallen down in design.  I would say that, if you have a need for a music player that is the right size for the gym or running, and 4 Gb is enough space for you for your day to day music needs, then the mini is not a bad solution. iPodlounge <!-- raw HTML omitted -->took one apart<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I spent some time yesterday compiling my requested time off for the next six months.  Once our busy season starts(mid-June), it&rsquo;s virtually impossible to get any time off.  I had a family vacation already planned for March, so it became unlikely that I could go to SXSW this year.  Instead, I&rsquo;ve decided to visit a good friend who recently moved to San Diego and, at the same time, attend the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2004 Coachella Valley Music Festival<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The artists performing at this festival read like a listing of my iTunes library. I figured that it would actually be cheaper to attend this festival than to attempt to see all of the acts I would want to see elsewhere. Also, a chance to see the Pixies again is hard to turn down, they were one of my favorite bands for a very long time.  If you&rsquo;ve ever been and have tips on attending, I&rsquo;d love to hear them, and I will post them here.  Thanks.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Well, it looks like it is certain now that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maurice Clarett will be in this year&rsquo;s NFL draft<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Quick background for you non-football folks.  This guy was a pretty impressive talent his freshman year at Ohio State.  Since then, he has gotten into all sorts of trouble, and been kicked off their team.  By the NFL&rsquo;s current rules, he was still too young to enter the draft, but he sued, and won, based on antitrust rules.  This is bad for the NFL, and for college football, as it opens the door for more underclassmen to enter the draft.  An excellent example of how this could gut college football can currently be found in the college basketball arena.  NBA teams now draft players based on potential, even if they are not currently ready to play at the NBA level.   The college basketball landscape is virtually devoid of stars now, because players are going to the NBA straight out of high school.  The NFL will almost surely suffer the same fate over time.  This will be complicated by the small size of the NFL roster and the amount of injuries that occur in a season.  NFL teams cannot generally afford to have roster spots being taken up by players not yet ready to play at the NFL level.</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s a tip that worked for me today, and it is probably pretty obvious, but since it worked so well, I figured I would point it out.  When purchasing a piece of software online today, I noticed, on the checkout page, that there was a form field for a coupon code.  So, I did a quick <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google<!-- raw HTML omitted --> search on the name of the software company and the word coupon.  Voila, a coupon code for a 40 percent discount presented itself in the first result, and it worked, saving me almost thirty dollars.  So, when in doubt, if there is a coupon field, search for a coupon.</p>

The resulting full cd of music is a phenomenal combination of the two, and I would say that it is greater than the sum of its parts, but I have too much respect for the original works.  The more familiar with The White Album you are, the more nuggets of listening goodness there seem to be for you.  It really is pretty amazing what Danger Mouse managed to create.</p>

There isn&rsquo;t anything to be gained by getting upset about this.  Clemens was a great Yankee, and I wish him the best in Houston.  If he is happier being closer to his family, I, for one, certainly wouldn&rsquo;t begrudge him that happiness.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m working from home today in order to take delivery of some new bedroom furniture.  Woot woot!!  It&rsquo;s been a long time in coming, but I think I have finally gotten into a &ldquo;nesting&rdquo; groove with my house.  Like so many other things in my life, I tend to look too much at the big picture, get overwhelmed, and get frustrated.  This tends to get worse with the house because it is a large place for one person, and the big yard and pool only make that worse.  This year, I have resolved to focus on one room, or one outdoor project, at a time.  I decided to start with the bedroom because it ends up being where I spend the bulk of my time.  As a result, the guest bedroom also gets an upgrade.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location-aware Devices, Privacy, and UI Design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Howard Rheingold is a solid treatment of the tough trade-off between this possibly very useful technology set and the privacy issues that it raises.  I&rsquo;m also interested in the set of issues as it maps to online social networks.  I&rsquo;ve thought, several times, that a granular approach to profiles on sites like Friendster and Tribe.net would be a better approach than the all or nothing/almost nothing approach that these sites currently employ.  After all, I would, for instance, want a potential mate to see a different set of things about me than a distant buddy that I hit the pubs with once in a while.  Not, mind you, in the sense that there would be a lack of integrity between the two.</p>

This seems to be a running theme with any type of Content Management System these days, and one that we have struggled with on PGA.com as well.(Todd mentioned this in the interview linked below.)  It&rsquo;s a difficult balance to strike between making sites easy to update, and preserving the perfect integrity of the code you posted in the first place.  This is further complicated by the fact that the bulk of these tools were, for the most part, coded when crappy markup wasn&rsquo;t considered such a big deal.  My perception, especially from talking to the tool vendors that I have worked with, is that their attitude is the dreaded &ldquo;it works on ie win32.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;d like to see more effort put into standardizing the markup created by the browser based WYSIWYG editors, because that is where a good chunk of the problem lies.  It&rsquo;s tough to draw any conclusion to this musing, but the other place where the problem exists is one that a good content management system should let you have control, in it&rsquo;s templating and element control system.  Most, if not all, full blown content management systems do not give you this level of control.</p>

			 <p>I got back last night, but was a bit too under the weather to get anything up on the site.  My 12&quot; Powerbook took a major turn for the worse on the Friday after Thanksgiving, forgetting somehow that letters before &ldquo;r&rdquo; in the alphabet existed.  This lead to a jumbled, alphabet soup computing experience.  Running Diskwarrior revealed that the Toshiba drive in the machine was about to fail.  Shortly thereafter, just after I got most of the data off of the machine, it did.  My experience may not be typical, but this is the second Apple laptop to have a major failure on me in less than a year.  It&rsquo;s under warranty, and no doubt it will get repaired, but the hassle these two failures have caused me is substantial.  This week&rsquo;s cost me several days worth of work, and I now find myself behind on a very important work project that has to launch this week.  I backup on a regular basis.  On the other hand, there is only so much you can do, especially when you are on the road.  I wish I felt like computer equipment had gotten more reliable over the years, but I definitely do not feel that this is the case.</p>

			 <p>So, I returned to Atlanta last night after almost a week in Salt Lake City.  It&rsquo;s a nice, smallish city, and the Macromedia conference was interesting, although I didn&rsquo;t feel like I learned nearly as much this year as I did last year.  One of the reasons for this was the fact that I spent more time in my hotel room working than I did actually at the conference.  The other thing, I believe is that I have spent the last year working with their latest versions, especially of ColdFusion, and so there was less new information to be had.</p>

			 <p>What an odd, and, at times, disturbing weekend.  Halloween was a great time, I dressed up as the Pope.  Had a great lunch and caught up with a friend on Saturday, and it was all downhill after that.  Spent most of the day today moping around the house.  Now I am watching football, and waiting for the Falcons to unravel the way my weekend did.</p>

			 <p>It has been well documented that it is a copy of the excellent Mac OS X utility Launchbar, but, for Windows XP users,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AppRocket<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a fantastic tool for launching applications and documents.  Having it on my Sony laptop has made my day today.  In addition to providing the functionality that Launchbar users might expect, the author has taught it a couple of new tricks, including the ability to read MP3 files' ID3 tags.  Every song in my music library is now only a few key clicks away.  If you are a Windows user, and are unfamiliar with Launchbar, I recommend downloading AppRocket and trying it out.  It requires the .NET framework.</p>

			 <p>My six day absence was caused by a variety of factors, but mainly the fact that I have been way behind with some of my household chores.  I spent a good chunk of the weekend cleaning my house up, and yesterday I had to take the day off to wait for the HVAC guy, and in the meantime I shredded two garbage bags full of old paperwork, receipts and credit card statements.  It feels good to get rid of the old, and I plan on dropping a carload of stuff off at Salvation Army this weekend.  I also managed to read a couple of books.</p>

			 <p>In case you are living under a rock, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iTunes for Windows<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  We tried it out in the office this afternoon as soon as it was available for download.  Pertty neat stuff.  Decent sized download(19+ Mb), I am guessing because it includes Quicktime 6.4.  Being able to include our Windows using bretheren in our office music sharing pool will be a huge plus, as it supports the sharing(streaming) of music libraries between platforms.  As far as I can tell, the only mistake that Apple seems to have made is screwing people who bought first and second generation iPods.  The redesigned iTunes Music Store is also quite nice.  I like the addition of audio books, although I doubt I will be using that feature much.  I think I will do another write up on the celebrity playlists, but they are an interesting idea that seems very well implemented.  Finally, Apple is including a lot more liner note information on the albums available.  That was one of the things that bothered me the most about the previous version of the iTunes Music Store.</p>

			 <p>I have a confession to make.  I still haven&rsquo;t seen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Matrix Reloaded<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I was supposed to go see it on the day it was released with everyone from work, but a server emergency prevented me from going.  Since then, I have somehow avoided spoilers, and I am looking forward to seeing it this week when it comes out on DVD.  For some reason, I have developed an intense dislike of going to see movies in the theater.  It may have something to do with the last year of my life being the first in something like ten years where I was single, and I really haven&rsquo;t dated all that much.  I also would rather spend the money I would spend on going to see a movie in the theater towards a DVD that I can watch over and over if I want to.  I&rsquo;m sure that, for some movies, like The Return of the King, I will make exceptions, and I might even go see Kill Bill this weekend, but for the most part, I&rsquo;m not going to the movie theater if I don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I went to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cubs vs. Braves Playoff game<!-- raw HTML omitted --> last night with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some friends<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It was a lot of fun, and the closest thing I can get to the American League playoff baseball that I really want to see.  It was interesting to see the contrast in the fans of the two teams.  There were several thousand Cub fans, some who were Atlanta transplants, and others who had travelled from Chicago for the game.  Braves fans tend to be a bit more gentile than I am used to, being from the Northeast.  The Chicago fans were more boisterous, and they have every right to be with their history. As a Yankees fan, it was sort of fun to go to the game without a pre-disposition to be a fan for either team. Overall, it was a fun game, what October baseball should be all about.  I&rsquo;m not so secretly hoping that the series will go five games so that I can see another one.  In the meantime, you can be sure that I will be glued to my television set for the game tonight.</p>

I&rsquo;ve been a Yankee fan pretty much my entire life, and the franchise has a history and spirit that most other franchises could only dream about.

I&rsquo;d love to see them face off against the reviled Red Sox in the next round.</p>

			 <p>I read through this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Macromedia Central Progress Update<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a couple of days ago, and I think I have reviewed most of the materials that Macromedia has released to the public on Central.  I have to admit, I don&rsquo;t get it.  Seriously, just like Tom Hanks in the movie Big during the business meeting, I don&rsquo;t get it.  I don&rsquo;t see how this is a viable part of Macromedia&rsquo;s strategy, how it fits into the rest of their enterprise.  Perhaps I need someone to explain it to me a bit better, or to see it in action, but I doubt it.  It just doesn&rsquo;t seem like a business that MM should be getting into to me.  They make tools and platforms for creating interactive content, and this seems to me to stray from that vision.</p>

			 <p>A grudgingly good <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Power Mac G5 review by PC Magazine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I wonder, looking at their performance chart, if they used the version of Photoshop that has been optimized for the G5 when doing their tests.  I would be very surprised if this were the case, they don&rsquo;t mention it in the piece, and it&rsquo;s the specific type of computing that the G5 would do well, so the Dell shouldn&rsquo;t be beating it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I got an email from PCMag about this post.  It appears that I missed the second page of the post where they explained the software configurations they used for testing.  They did use the G5 optimized version of Photoshop.  Interesting.</p>

			 <p>It occurred to me in thinking about the Apple Corps lawsuit against Apple this morning that Apple hasn&rsquo;t used the &ldquo;Apple&rdquo; name in the name of its music store, it&rsquo;s called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The iTunes Music Store<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  If you go to the store through iTunes, there isn&rsquo;t an Apple logo to be found in the store interface (although there is one in the iTunes application itself), and no mention of Apple Computer aside from the copyright statement.  I suspect that this is intentional, and meant to comply with the spirit of their earlier settlement.  Remember that the settlement was about each company&rsquo;s right to use the &ldquo;Apple&rdquo; trademark.  The wording of the quote from the Apple Corps lawyer in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> made me think about this.  Somehow, I doubt very much that there will be any merit to this lawsuit, although there is no way of really knowing without a copy of that earlier settlement.</p>

			 <p>So last weekend, I ended up leaving my phone in a cab at the end of Saturday night.  I couldn&rsquo;t remember which one of the many Atlanta Cab companies I had used, as I picked the cab up outside of the Dark Horse here in Atlanta.  I awoke the next morning, realized I had lost my phone, and called it several times with no luck.  Eventually, I gave up and went and purchased a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sony Ericsson T616<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It seems like a great phone so far, I love the Bluetooth and iSync support, and I just installed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Salling Clicker<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Pretty neat to be able to use the cellphone as a remote control for my Powerbook.  Should be even more interesting when I delve a bit more into the scripting side of things.</p>

I backed everything up, because you never know, and dropped the machine off at the local Apple for shipment back to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Thursday.  I was absolutely shocked to get a call yesterday to let me know that it was back and I could come pick it up.

They also replaced the missing feet from the bottom of the machine that have been missing since I bought.  All in all, a great experience, thanks Apple.</p>

			 <p>I went and got my hair cut this afternoon.  For years, I had long hair, and I only got a haircut every three of four months, there was no need to do otherwise.  Since I went the short hair route six months ago, I have to go every six weeks or so to keep the appearance of neatness.  Not that I mind the whole personal grooming routine, I think I actually enjoy it more than most men I know.  They mostly seem to want to go in to get their hair cut and spend as little time maintaining their hair every day as possible.  Anyway, I&rsquo;m digressing, this is supposed to be an essay about will power or, more accurately, the battle of the hair styles that occurs on my head every six weeks.  I go to a fancy salon, it&rsquo;s an indulgence that I allow myself, and I really enjoy the whole process of going, changing into the special salon robe, getting a scalp massage, a shampoo, and finally getting my hair cut.  While this has all gone well, it&rsquo;s the styling part, post-haircut, where the trouble arises.  While I am keeping things pretty conservative, my stylist likes to make some artisitic choices when styling my hair that I am not certain work for me.  He&rsquo;s an artist though, and I don&rsquo;t want to belittle his judgement because he probably does know better than I do what works.  Don&rsquo;t laugh at me when I call him an artist, do you have any idea the havoc that a bad haircut can wreak in one&rsquo;s life?  So anyway, I&rsquo;m sitting here in Starbucks, connected to the Wi-Fi, wondering whether I should be styling my hair when I get up tomorrow the way he styled it this afternoon, or the way that I think it should be styled.</p>

Taking a simplistic viewpoint, it might seem like Dave Winer against the rest of the blog-tool vendors and a smattering of community folks.  It seems, from my perspective, that both groups have written things that are somewhat questionable, but I don&rsquo;t really want to get into a &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna take a side and here is why the other guys are wrong&rdquo; position.  From my perspective, as a real long term blog maintainer guy, it seems like there was an infrastructure in blogland that worked pretty well, and could be enhanced over time if everyone could work together, which seems unlikely from what I have seen.  Since it seemed unlikely that everyone could work together, which, in my perception, has very little to do with the technology side of things, one group decided to build a new set of infrastructure for blogland.  It seems like a huge undertaking from the perspective of arriving at a consensus and then properly implementing and testing this consensus in software.  These wheels are in motion, and while it does no one any harm for me to express an opinion about this, I doubt there is much that anyone could do to halt the inertia of the situation.  So I will just say this, it seems, from what I can tell, that there is no one in this situation who is primarily motivated by the practical good of blogland itself.  I find this frustrating, but I am going to go get a nice cup of coffee now, and then I might read a book.</p>

			 <p>Heh, well I almost don&rsquo;t even know where to start and where to end with this post. I have so much stuff going on in my head.  Last week, after tidying work things up after the weekend&rsquo;s tournaments and what not, I struck out on a mini-holiday to sunny Miami.  Late June in Miami is supposed to be their offseason, and the general idea was to keep to myself, relax, and destress as much as possible.  I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed taking off on my own like this, being in a strange city alone doesn&rsquo;t appeal to most people, as far as I can tell, but there is something about the anonymity of it that I really seem to enjoy.  I could tell, even from the reactions of the people who work in the hospitality industry down there, that most people seem to view people who are on vacation alone like they are some kind of freaks.</p>

			 <p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of coverage of the WWDC keynote elsewhere, so I&rsquo;ll just give a couple of opinions and call it a day.  First, Panther looks great, there are a lot of changes at the system level that make sense and were expected.  The new features all make sense strategically, and put them solidly ahead of MSFT in the OS innovation department yet again.  MSFT has attempted to create buzz for Longhorn, something that won&rsquo;t see the light of day for another two years at least.  I can only imagine all the innovations we&rsquo;ll see from our friends in Cupertino in the same time period.  Second, I&rsquo;m drooling over the new hardware architecture.  It puts Apple in a place where they can plausibly compete with the Wintel architecture, even if they are only slightly behind in performance, the OS is so much better that it makes for a good argument.  By the time the machines hit the streets, the top end Wintel machine will be faster than the one we saw today.  Regardless, I will be replacing my aged tower when these machines hit the streets, and I&rsquo;m excited to see what they, and Panther, can do.</p>

			 <p>I suspect that the sustained amount of tracks that Apple will continue to sell via the iTunes music store will continue to decrease.  I think this because they don&rsquo;t seem to have the new releases that matter to what I perceive as their target audience.  The new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Radiohead<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cd, Hail to the Thief, was released today, and it is nowhere to be found on the iTunes music store.  In fact, they also do not have about ten other new major label releases that I think matter from the last couple of months.  For instance, the new Metallica cd, although that may have something to do with Metallica themselves, I find it amusing that their music is not available via this legal electronic distribution channel when they complained so vehemently about Napster.  While adding the indies will be a huge step forward, and I am happy to see Apple pursuing them, I think they need to take a look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Billboard top 200 album chart<!-- raw HTML omitted --> every week, and ask themselves why about half the CD&rsquo;s on the current one are not available from their store.  I don&rsquo;t think a brick and mortar store would find it acceptable to only have half the merchandise that their customers were asking for, and I hope that Apple is treating this the same way.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s odd, I find myself in this weird purgatory of relationship land.  I&rsquo;ve been single, after about eight years of being in a single relationship, for about eight months.  I thought originally that I would remain single for a few months, then be ready to date again.  Unfortunately, I think the heart takes longer to heal than I originally thought.  Of course, this depends on the type of person that you are.  I find myself still missing her, and it&rsquo;s not easy for me to say that at all.  It&rsquo;s even more difficult to write about it in an open manner like this, but I think that it&rsquo;s good for me to express these thoughts.  I shouldn&rsquo;t miss her, I keep telling myself.  Eight months is a long time to get used to the idea of not having someone in your life.  I have wondered quite a bit if it was my loneliness that was driving that feeling, missing waking up next to someone that you want to spend time with, the meals out, the closeness and ability to confide in another person without reservation.  I&rsquo;ve tried to date, and discovered that I am still too messed up emotionally to pull it off.  There&rsquo;s parts of me that are ready, without any doubt at all, but the core, my &ldquo;rendering engine&rdquo; so to speak, is just still too confused.  Unfortunately, the end result is a person with this hint of constant sadness, at least internally.  I bought a shirt last week that has the slogan &ldquo;I believe the next time I fall in love it will be forever,&rdquo;  and god do I want to believe that, really I do.</p>

			 <p>In other sports related news, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Roger Clemens got his 299th career victory last night<!-- raw HTML omitted --> against the arch-rival Red Sox.  Not only does the win put the Yankees a game ahead of the Sox in first place, but it sets the table for a Memorial Day matchup between the two teams that could be Clemens' 300th victory.  I&rsquo;ve seen the Rocket pitch several times, but the most memorable was two years ago, at Fenway.  He was throwing hard, and still had good velocity in the late innings of the game.  I really hope that he goes into the Hall of Fame as a Yankee, he&rsquo;s meant a lot to us Yankee fans over the last few years.</p>

			 <p>I guess just about everyone must know from all of the media attention that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Annika Sorenstam is playing the PGA Tour event this week<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, The Colonial.  Lots of differing opinions about this, but I&rsquo;m happy for her that she is going to get to see what she can do at the highest level and I wish her the best.  I think, however, based on the conditions out there today, that she will have an uphill battle making the cut.  I think if the conditions were better on the course, and the ball would roll more, that she would have a much better chance.  Having said that, I went out and played eighteen holes of golf with my co-workers on Tuesday, and I have a lot of respect for the way these folks, both the men and women, play.  It&rsquo;s not an easy sport to master, and especially where consistency is involved.</p>

			 <p>So I bought a new 12&quot; Powerbook about a week ago.  My old powerbook had totally died due to a video chipset issue.  Aside from the video, the machine works fine, so I may have to do something funky with it.  Back to the new Powerbook, I thought that I would feel like the 12&quot; would be too small, but I didn&rsquo;t want to spend the money for the 17&quot; and buying another somewhat outdated 15&quot; seemed silly.  I was wrong though, I don&rsquo;t feel like it is too small screen wise for my use of it.  The fact that it is so small makes it easier to carry around, and I&rsquo;m really enjoying it.</p>

			 <p>I find it very interesting that, in one of Apple&rsquo;s spots for the iTunes Music Store, Bono mentions a Clash song.  Robert then realizes that there are a couple of classic Clash albums he wouldn&rsquo;t mind having again, and logs into the store when he gets back to net land.  Aghast, he discovers that, whole almost all of the Clash&rsquo;s albums are listed, exactly none of them are available in their entirety for purchase.  For my money, all lot of the context that makes these works as great as they are is in listening to the record/CD/music as a whole work.</p>

It looked as if the new Jack Johnson was scheduled to be available a week prior to its release elsewhere, but that hasn&rsquo;t actually happened, which is dissapointing.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This knowledge base<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article denotes the differences between iPod software 2.0, which comes with the new iPods that start to appear in consumers hands tomorrow, and iPod software 1.3, which is the update they just released for the first and second generation iPods so that they could play the new AAC file format that the iTunes music store employs.  This information, to me, is disturbing, and not just because I own a second generation iPod that is less than six months old.  I would hope that Apple is not so short sighted that the new iPods are can&rsquo;t use the same code for a simple alarm clock.  It pisses me off because the 20Gb iPod wasn&rsquo;t a small purchase for me, and I would expect them to continue to update the OS and firmware within a reasonable set of parameters.  I can only surmise that this is another case of Apple being greedy because they did the absolute minimum for existing iPod owners.   That refrain, for me at least, is getting more and more tiresome as time goes on.  I&rsquo;m at the crossroads, and I need to buy a new machine in the next couple of months, and I have to say that this stuff will factor into my decision.</p>

			 <p>So it&rsquo;s official.  I will be without a Mac OS machine for the foreseeable future.  I don&rsquo;t see much point in replacing the motherboard on the two year old TiBook when it will cost nearly as much as replacing the machine altogether.  I have a Sony Windows XP laptop that I will have to make due with in the interim, and I hope to be able to afford a new Mac in the next few weeks at some point.  It&rsquo;s really a shame that they soldered the video chipset onto the mobo like they did, it makes something that should be a couple of hundred dollar part, at the most, a critical point of failure for the entire machine.  The only saving grace is that I have been using the Windows laptop for work extensively the last few months, and that I lost no data from the TiBook, which is essentially an external firewire drive now.  I think that I will be purchasing a 17 inch Powerbook when I do replace it.  Despite it&rsquo;s largish size, I think it is a much better fit for me than the 12 inch, I use my laptop primarily as a desktop replacement, rarely on my lap, or on planes.  I&rsquo;m not really travelling for work at all.  There is a part of me that got burned with the first generation TiBook, its crappy slot loading drive, low video memory, and lack of an internal cd burner, that wants me to wait for the second generation 17 inch before making a purchase.  The difficulty with that is that there is really no way to tell when that will be released.  I don&rsquo;t want to wait for MacWorld this summer, or even until WWDC, for another Powerbook.  If you have the scoop on this, I&rsquo;d love to hear about it.</p>

			 <p>I finally got around to reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JJG&rsquo;s The Elements of User Experience<!-- raw HTML omitted --> last night.  It makes for a quick read, and I think I polished it off in about an hour or so.  I&rsquo;m not sure why I put off reading it for as long as I did now, it made for great mental fuel for some things I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a lot lately in terms of project planning and what should drive each part of the development and design process.  I think that I already conduct projects where I have the ability to dictate process in a very similar manner to the one he suggests in the book, but it was interesting to see the way in which he presented the material, and to see what distinctions he drew in defining his process and the various components of it.  I believe that most Web professionals I have worked with over the last couple of years know that there is a right way to do these things, and have a decent idea of what that right way might be, but I find that most resign themselves to not being able to actually conduct business in that manner because of clients and other factors.  I&rsquo;m not one to resign myself in this way, and it bothers me that people just give up on doing things the right way because it has either always been done another, less effective, way or because they are too tired to fight for the right way.  It just seems so obvious to me that approaching these things in a methodological manner yields better results, and my anecdotal experience mirrors this.</p>

Well sometimes it works for about two minutes after I reboot the machine, but then it decides to go flaky again.

			 <p>So I&rsquo;ve been tracking the press reaction to Hayley and to Mr. Personality in general.  Not that I am a big fan of shows like this one, far from it,  but it&rsquo;s somewhat interesting to see how the makers of the show frame the personality of the main character, knowing a little of her  personality myself.  There&rsquo;s been a mix of reactions, most of them not terribly insightful.  Of course the most interesting ones are the negative ones.  For instance, it seems our friend over at Slate would like to see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more Monica and less Hayley<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is weird because I find Hayley to be anything but &ldquo;forgettable&rdquo; and &ldquo;fatuous,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;d had enough of bland old Monica years ago.  Had to stick that SAT word in there to up your literary cred, didn&rsquo;t you?  I found it interesting that on  the show they had her sit down with the contestants and astrologers because she seemed to be very interested in that particular thing the night we all hung out.  We all went around and revealed what sign we were, and talked about what signs were compatible with each other.  I wonder if that was previously scripted into the show or if they built that from her interests.   Ratings were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pretty strong<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I think the best overview of the first episode is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Zap2It.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->New Hulk Trailer looks great<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I guess I should have expected no less from Ang Lee. It seems like some folks, who might be less familiar with The Hulk comics, and more familiar with The Hulk television series, are having a hard time understanding that this movie is more accurate to the original comics, from the looks of things, than their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lou Ferrigno<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version.  I find this amusing, when people say it looks fake and that the Hulk is not strong enough to say, for instance, throw a tank.  It&rsquo;s difficult to disagree with these folks without sounding like a complete comic nerd.  When I say, for instance, that The Hulk is the strongest character in the Marvel universe, I usually get nothing but snickers.  I guess I will have to come to grips that there is a comic nerd within me.</p>

Umm, what is the deal with this?  It&rsquo;s the week before Thanksgiving?  Someone over there needs to have their head examined.  They had announced that it was going to be held in San Diego this year at last year&rsquo;s show, which I enjoyed thoroughly.  It has been held in October, in a warm climate, the last two years.

			 <p>Well, since <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Todd<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  went ahead and linked to it, I&rsquo;ll add that the project I have been working on for the last couple of months is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PGA.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well.  My area(s) of the project included a variety of tasks, but the single largest one was building a real time golf scoring system that integrated with a few different XML golf scoring feeds on the back end, and with our content management system for output.   Since some of our vendors for scoring had never used XML before, I had the opportunity to actually author my own XML format for golf scoring.  I&rsquo;ve learned a lot along the way about the challenges of using XML for something like this.  The vendors that had their own xml formats, by and large, didn&rsquo;t understand the value of maintaining the semantic nature of the information they were marking up.  They were obviously used to output markup, like html, and so combined unlike information into elements, did not name like information attributes consistently,  and generally did not implement XML in a manner that made lot of sense.  This meant that I had to do some gymnastics to get the information out of the XML in a raw form.  One thing I can tell you is that ColdFusion MX might just be the best platform to use for doing XML development available right now.  My development time was considerably lower than some of the open source XML software that I have worked with in the past, and I had little trouble adding additional vendors once I had built the initial framework.  ColdFusion Components make it much easier to swap out the data layer of an application without having to rewrite everything that sits on top of the data layer.  I guess I will post more about this in the coming weeks, we&rsquo;ve got a lot of other work that we want to do, and some great ideas for future features and development.</p>

			 <p>While I was in Aruba, I read both Pattern Recognition and Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom.  I enjoyed both books for different reasons.  William Gibson&rsquo;s writing has gotten better with each of his books in my opinion.  He does a great job of setting a mood for the book, and then playing a melody around that mood.  It seemed to me that Pattern Recognition explored territory that none of his previous books have explored as well, this sort of texture of life that revolves around design and brand in today&rsquo;s world.</p>

			 <p>Eeesh, I&rsquo;m tired.  I&rsquo;ve worked every day since I got back from a wonderful, relaxing trip to Aruba with my entire family.  In the three weeks that have passed since then, I have basically lived at the office.  It&rsquo;s gotten pretty bad.  Last night, I took a nap when I got home from work at sixish. When my alarm went off a little after seven,  I was supposed to be getting ready to meet someone for dinner.  Instead, I got up and began getting ready to go into the office.  It literally was about ten minutes before I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be going into the office.  What ensued was a great sushi dinner with good conversation and plenty of Saba and Tako, but I was a little horrified that I&rsquo;m that far into automatic mode.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Konfabulator<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this weekend a bit.   It uses the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spidermonkey<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Javascript runtime from the Mozilla project as it&rsquo;s core.  I think it&rsquo;s worth noting that we are seeing more and more fruits of open source code on the Mac OS X platform all the time now.  Open Source seems to be enabling innovation, and writing something like Konfabulator from scratch would proabably have been a much more daunting task without the ability to embed the Javascript runtime.  I seem to be seeing people note on a regular basis that Mac OS X is the best platform for innovation by independent developers now, and open source code is one big reason for that.</p>

It&rsquo;s an addictive adrenaline rush, and has left me wondering why it hasn&rsquo;t taken off more than it has.  I followed that up with a softball practice on Monday for the team I joined for this spring, &ldquo;Team Bad Guy.&rdquo;  So I&rsquo;ve been a bit sore the last couple of days, these sports use different muscles than my normal gym workouts.  Aside from that, lots of house maintenance tasks this week, and a lot of worrying about finishing tasks properly at my current position before moving on to the new one on Monday.</p>

			 <p>Politically, I&rsquo;m most definitely an independent.  Invariably, this leads to healthy disagreements with people from both sides of the political spectrum.  Generally, I tend to be more socially liberal, and more fiscally conservative.  From Republicans, especially the tow the party line sort that I tend to be exposed to these days, I tend to get a liberal label, and they seem to use this label in a very mean spirited manner, although I think I&rsquo;m much closer to centrist Republicans than I am to most Democrats.  I tend to differ from Democrats in terms of practical matters, at least in my viewpoint.  I find some of their stands to be just silly.  I&rsquo;ve been studying up a little on possible candidates in 2004 from the Democrats, especially since <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dori and Tom<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have been covering it once in a while.  This has led me to believe that the person who has announced for 2004 that is the most similar to my viewpoints thus far is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Howard Dean<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  This leads to somewhat of a problem for me, he really doesn&rsquo;t have the fund raising or organizational support that is necessary to win a nomination.  I find this especially troubling because I was the first person to be critical of people throwing their support behind non-practical candidate Ralph Nader in 2000.  I wish that Bush&rsquo;s policies resembled those under which he campaigned in 2000, but they don&rsquo;t and they seem to be going further right as time goes on.  We need campaign finance reform in a big way so that people like Howard Dean have a practical chance of winning.</p>

			 <p>In the NFL playoffs, things went much the way I expected them to yesterday.  I realize now that it would be more fair of me to make predictions public before I make such claims.  So we have the two teams with pirate symbols playing the big game next weekend.  I haven&rsquo;t fully thought through the matchup yet, but I am willing to bet that this game will not be a blowout in either direction.  After seeing the games yesterday, I have to give the coaching edge to Tampa Bay, their gameplan against Philadelphia was perfect, and their players executed on it.  The Raider&rsquo;s offense hasn&rsquo;t seen a defense in the same league as the one they will be facing next weekend.  So I guess I am leaning towards Tampa Bay at this point.</p>

			 <p>Well, I&rsquo;m on the cusp of a decision about new hardware for this coming year.  I have decided that there are three ways to go, but haven&rsquo;t/can&rsquo;t make up my mind about things.  Right now I have a first generation TiBook which came with a 500Mhz processor, an underpowered graphics card, a 30Gb hard drive, and 512 Mb of RAM.  I also have a Sony Vaio laptop which has a 650Mhz P3, a 20Gb hard drive, 512 Mb of RAM, and an underpowered graphics card.  I can&rsquo;t afford to replace both of these machines this year, and the TiBook is slightly older than the Vaio, so I&rsquo;m leaning that way.  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Area 51<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, however, looks real nice and the benchmarks on it are sick.  On the other hand, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a 17 inch screen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seems like a good thing to have.  So it&rsquo;s either replace one of these two machines, or make some incremental upgrades to one or both of them.  There aren&rsquo;t any processor upgrades or video chipset upgrades available for the TiBook or the Vaio though.  So I could add more RAM, and upgrade the hard drive, but I&rsquo;m stuck with the internals.  Decisions, Decisions.</p>

			 <p>Infosync: AT &amp; T Wireless subscribers will be able to vote on the next American Idol season using their SMS capable phones according to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I&rsquo;m sure this is just a trial balloon for the network and ATT, but this could be the start of something a lot bigger here in the US where SMS hasn&rsquo;t really taken off like in Japan and the Scandinavian countries.  I think my major concern about the possible success of something like this is that even most tech savvy people I know don&rsquo;t use SMS messaging from their phones at all.  My more non-technical friends don&rsquo;t even know how to use the phone in this manner.  My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Danger<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which supports sms messaging, has the major hole in it&rsquo;s operating system that does not let you generate SMS messages from listings in your address book.  I think that the current lines of phones could be improved quite a bit in terms of the ease of text messaging.</p>

The good news is that, as of April, the phone jack requirement to access program data will go away, and you will be able to connect to their service online.  The not so good news is that it looks like those of us with first series machines will not get all of the new features.  I guess I&rsquo;m not that concerned about that particular aspect, I&rsquo;m going to hold onto this first generation machine, with its lifetime subscription to the service, as long as I can.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mariucci is fired by 49ers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Not such a good move for the franchise as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the guy is one of the best coaches in the league.  I get the impression that this thing is really about egos and coaching styles.  Bill Walsh, who is one of the greatest offensive minds in the history of the game, wanted to run one style of offense with, of course, a pass focus.  Mariucci wanted to run the ball more.  I&rsquo;m certain that he won&rsquo;t be looking for a job for very long.  Personally, I&rsquo;d love to see him here in Atlanta, but I doubt that is going to happen any time in the near future.(That&rsquo;s another post for another time.)</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matt is at Yosemite<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I went there years ago, before my involvement in the Web, and before I was chained to my desk at work all day moving text around on a screen.  I think at the time, I was splitting my time between DJing at a club two nights a week, working at a record store three or four days a week, and working at a comic shop on the weekend days.  That&rsquo;s not really very relevant to this post though.  Yosemite changed me as a person.  The place is like a church to me.  The scale of everything reminded me how small I am, and how large and beautiful the world is.  I suspect a lot of that had to do with the fact that I was living in a very urban New York environment at the time.  I think about that trip all the time, not because I think about the woman I was dating at the time who went with me, but because I was changed as a person from standing in that park.  Oddly, I haven&rsquo;t gotten back there since that trip despite many business and pleasure trips to California since then.  America is a grand country, with so much to see, so much beauty, and so many incredible people, it makes vacation planning a nightmare in a good way.</p>

I mean, this is one of the primary purposes of having a blog in the first place.  Come on people, get with the program, get some perspective on what people use their blogs for, and clean up that darned copyright statement too.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: you can include links and styled text in postings as documented <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

			 <p>Console games, especially those for the PS2, have taken a sort of weird turn in the last year.  It&rsquo;s becoming more and more common for the more popular games to try and sell more merchandise than just that particular game.  Two recent examples from my gaming library include <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Grand Theft Auto: Vice City<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Madden NFL 2003<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  In order to get to additional cheat codes for Vice City, one can purchase one of the six soundtrack cd&rsquo;s that go along with the game or the boxed set of all six cd&rsquo;s.  In order to get to some of the cheat cards in Madden, one must own other EA Sports games.  I suspect that many other gamers fall victim to the same anxiety over possibly missing out on something cool that I do, leading to the purchase of some or all of these additional objects.  I wonder how long this will go on before it gets completely ridiculous.</p>

			 <p>So I&rsquo;m back in Atlanta after my whirlwind tour of the Northeast, back at work and trying to figure out where exactly I left off before Christmas, which is proving to be a more difficult task than I would have thought.  I return from the holiday personally energized in a way that I was not energized prior to the holiday.  The one thing that I can say with some level of certainty is that family is perhaps the most vital thing in a person&rsquo;s life.  This Christmas, we severely limited the gift giving.  I actually liked it much better than I would have thought.  It put the emphasis on what the holidays are really about for me, catching up with the family, and getting to spend time with them.  My brothers and parents are great people, and by being a part of the family, it makes me feel like a great person too.  It centers me in a way that no interaction with non-family members can.  It really makes me look forward to having a family of my own some day.  Not that I&rsquo;m in any rush on that front mind you.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m in New York City, enjoying my brothers' company before departing for Atlanta in the morning.  We went into a Tower Records downtown, and I didn&rsquo;t buy a thing.  Compact Discs have gotten way too expensive if you ask me.  Case in point, I looked at the Goldmember Soundtrack because we&rsquo;ve been laughing and enjoying the song that Dr. Evil performs in the movie.  The soundtrack cost $18.99.  The movie, on DVD, was priced at $19.99.  How the hell can the soundtrack cost only one dollar less than the entire movie?  It&rsquo;s just ridiculous.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m home in Connecticut for the holidays with my family.  In the past, this has meant either a return to dialup access or using my parents oldish PC for my computing needs.  However, my brother and I discovered that someone in our parent&rsquo;s neighborhood has a WiFi network that we can connect to.  I intend to use some stumbling software to figure out exactly who it is and let them know that people can hop on to make sure they have no problem with it, but it&rsquo;s nice to be able to do the things I normally do online from the comfort of my parents' living room.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m beginning to prepare myself to try and quit smoking again.  I seem to have the best success in the first couple of months when I give myself some ramp up time, start working out every day without fail, and mentally prepare myself.  I seem to have the worst success when alcohol is introduced into my bloodstream, which means I am bound to be the designated driver for a while.  I&rsquo;m thinking that January would be a good month to start.  Not the cliche January first start because that actually might be too soon.  I will be using the patch sans Zyban this time.  It&rsquo;s never the quitting process that fails, it&rsquo;s the life as a quit addict that follows that I seem to have a hard time with.  Well, we&rsquo;ll see, won&rsquo;t we.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had a wireless network in my house for a little over two years now, I bought one of the original Airport base stations when they were released.  I&rsquo;ve gotten very used to being able to compute from the living room, the bedroom, the kitchen and, of course, my office at home.  For some reason, I rarely roam outside there areas, or leave the house to compute.  This morning, I&rsquo;ve been hanging out in a Starbucks near my house, using some of the minutes that I bought when I went to SXSW earlier this year.  I don&rsquo;t know why, but I seem to enjoy this more than my normal wireless at home.  I like being around people, hanging out, drinking coffee and reading.  This is bad in a way because this costs money based on how long I use it, and my access at home does not.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been making the transition to single life very slowly.  It&rsquo;s not easy getting over being in love with someone.  At times, I feel like someone who has lost an arm or a leg must feel, there is something missing that is supposed to be there.  As time goes by, and the reality that this is what it is sets in, I&rsquo;m beginning to think about women in a way I haven&rsquo;t thought them in eight years.  Let me tell you secret about men, we fall in love way too easily.  Now, I know what you are saying to yourself, that based on what you have seen, that is not true at all, that men don&rsquo;t behave in a manner that would indicate that this is true at all.  I would disagree completely.  Men fall in love way too easily, and this makes our lives all that much more confusing than they should be.</p>

			 <p>I was thinking this morning that I want to make some top ten lists at the end of the year.  In past years, when I wanted to make a top ten list of records, I would have to dig a bit.  What came out this year?  This year, I fired up iTunes, created a new smart playlist that filtered out anything that was not released this year.  So for the next week, I can listen to nothing but the music I bought that came out this year.  Imagine that, and the CD&rsquo;s will sit in their drawer where they belong.  I love technology.</p>

I doubt very much that I would have come through my situations as well without her music.  Her band sounded tight and she has some really talented musicians playing with her.  My brother is also friends with Aimee&rsquo;s guitar player and producer, Michael Lockwood.  After the show, we got to hang out a bit before they hit the road for tonight&rsquo;s date in North Carolina.  He&rsquo;s a really nice guy, down to Earth, and also a Mac and technology savvy person.  If you have a chance to see her, I assure you that you won&rsquo;t be dissapointed one bit.</p>

			 <p>Pretty uninteresting week so far.  I had a good weekend.  Not much else to add.  I&rsquo;m working on a few different things in my spare time, and trying to log a few extra hours at work this week to make up for the two days off.  Not getting paid for the holidays is the one thing about being an independent consultant that I am still not quite used to.  Having said that, the benefits of being independent have outweighed the negatives.  I like leaving work at the office, not feeling compelled to work a ton of extra hours without additional pay, and the fact that the current office is less than a mile from my house is a big plus.</p>

I&rsquo;ve also found that the ability to AIM people from things like meetings is both useful and a pleasant distraction during boring lectures.  I haven&rsquo;t explored bloggin with it, and I&rsquo;m not sure that I would write my best entries that way either.  Finally, being able to check things on the Web from wherever I am is a useful tool that has already settled one argument very quickly.</p>

			 <p>Well, today is Friday.  This week has just flown by on me.  Notable music this week included the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Audioslave cd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that I had been waiting for.  As a longtime Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine fan, I wasn&rsquo;t sure exactly what to expect from the cd, and I haven&rsquo;t been dissapointed at all.  The songs tend to be a mixed bag, with some sounding to me like they were written by Chris Cornell and others sounding as if they were Rage songs that he was just singing over.  Only once in the whole time that I have been listening to the cd have I thought that a song sounded like Zach should have been rapping over it rather than Cornell singing over it. Some of the other artists that I have been listening to quite a bit these days are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neko Case<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who&rsquo;s dark brand of alt-country I can&rsquo;t get enough of, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->matt pond PA<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who are playing here this weekend.  The surprise of the week is how much I love the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pearl Jam<!-- raw HTML omitted --> CD.  I hadn&rsquo;t completely written them off, but I have to admit that while I like their music, I&rsquo;ve never been their biggest fan.  The new CD is different somehow, and I have been listening to it quite a bit while working this week.  It may also be that, in my emotional post-breakup emotional condition, that this type of music appeals to me more.</p>

			 <p>So, my hiptop just stopped working over the weekend.  It wouldn&rsquo;t connect to the network for either phone or data.  It kept telling me its sim wasn&rsquo;t ready.  So I took the sim out and put it back in, and reset the device.  Still no luck, I did the same thing again, no dice.  I started to get frustrated, and finally, I went to the T-Mobile store where I bought it yesterday.  They tried the same things I had already done because I clearly couldn&rsquo;t know how to do such things properly.  They then told me to call customer care because I would need to request a replacement device.  So I called customer care, and they informed me that someone had made a mistake on their end that had knocked all of the hiptops off of the network.  So, if your hiptop is not currently working, all you need to do is find someone else with a T-Mobile phone, put your sim card in their phone, wait for a text message, and then put the card back in your hiptop.  I&rsquo;m annoyed that T-Mobile doesn&rsquo;t have better communication with their retail outlets about problems like this.</p>

			 <p>I am finding that I often do not do a good job of composing email for the particular person that I am writing that email to.  I was thinking about this subject this morning.  Thinking that I spend a lot of time writing each email message, crafting the sentences, and then reading and re-reading the message to make sure that I have been clear in what I am attempting to say and that there is little chance of misinterpretation.  I was then mentally complaining to myself that people do not read nearly as carefully as they should.  It seems every day that someone misreads something I have written in an email, and I am forced to send additional email messages attempting to more clearly explain what I was trying to say.  A couple of hours later I realized that I was composing each email as if I was writing it to myself, not to the particular person to whom the email was going.  It&rsquo;s my careless writing, not your careless reading.  Sorry everyone.</p>

			 <p>Mac Observer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is reporting<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that TechTV reported that Apple and AMD are going to make some sort of announcement today last night.  They also point out that Darwin x86 does not currently run on AMD processors, and that this may be an announcement that Apple is going to start supporting them.  Of course, if that is the announcement, it could also be Apple hedging their bets in public to send a message to Motorola.</p>

			 <p>The rumor I am hearing this morning from Comdex is that Apple and AMD are going to make some sort of announcement at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this morning&rsquo;s keynote address<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I guess you could speculate somewhat as to the nature of the announcement, but with the obvious processor differential between the current line of PowerPC based Apple hardware and stadard Wintel PC&rsquo;s, I can only think that this means Apple will be releasing machines based on AMD&rsquo;s Hammer processor line.  I&rsquo;m surprised, based on how I heard about this, that I haven&rsquo;t seen any coverage in the Mac OS community yet.  Perhaps it is because Comdex is not normally an Apple event.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AMDZone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has reported that there is a large Apple presence at the event.  This is the first other report about this topic I have been able to find.</p>

			 <p>Well, I got my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Danger Sidekick<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Friday, and I have had a few days to evaluate the pluses and minuses of this device versus a Palm OS based Device or my PocketPC.  Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stellar deal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that Amazon was offering on the device, that is definitely the way to go currently if you are considering buying one.   In short, I really like the device, with a few minor things that I would like to see changed in an update.  First, I will not be able to get rid of my regular cellphone because the current plan that is available for the device is very sparse on minutes.  Of course, it makes up for the lack of minutes with unlimited data.  The device is very easy to use and to learn how to use.   I still haven&rsquo;t gotten the T-Mobile Web Interface for the device to work properly for me, which means I&rsquo;ll have to write that up another time.  While it is larger than a regular cellphone, it is still smaller than I thought it would be.  Using it as a phone, I had no complaints about clarity or reception using it either as a regular handset or with the provided hands free attachment.  I used AIM on the device extensively from various Atlanta locations this weekend, and I found the keyboard to be very usable for this purpose and for typing email. The Web browser works well enough with the limitations of the small screen, but it seemed to have a much harder time working with CSS loaded pagesthan regular table layouts.  Overall, the data service experience of the device was very good. However, I live inside the city of Atlanta, and it seemed that the coverage for the data network was very spotty.  Your mileage may very there depending on the city you live in.  More later&hellip;.</p>

			 <p>I went to a T-Mobile store near the office I am currently consulting out of and checked out the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hiptop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that they are now offering.  I have been thinking about getting a device like this for a while now, and the only real options are this device and the PocketPC Phone Edition, which is much more expensive.  After playing with it for a little while, I wanted to purchase the device there and then.  However, in accordance with my new policy about technology purchases, I then entered the one day waiting period that all purchases less than $500 require.  (If it is more than $500, the waiting goes up to 5 days.)  So I believe that, unless I change my mind, I will be purchasing said device after work this afternoon.  My first impression of the device was that I wanted it to be a color one.  I guess they are going to come out with a color version at some point, but who knows what the price will be, and what the implications for battery life will be.</p>

			 <p>Out yet again last night. I really have to stay in tonight because I am just exhausted.  Some sushi as per the normal Thursday night routine, and then pool playing with friends of my family who were passing through town on a cross country journey.  Today, I&rsquo;m mostly musing about my current recovery status, and pecking away at work.  It&rsquo;s very hard to judge where I am at in terms of my healing process.  I&rsquo;m very impatient to get through the negative part of this, but I think I understand that it&rsquo;s not a good thing to rush in order to heal myself properly. I think that I also am sort of struggling with what to share here and what not to share.  It definitely helps me sort things out when I write about it here, but I also run the risk of alienating you folks reading and of having the wrong person read this stuff.  Then again this is my site, and these are my feelings, which are valid.</p>

			 <p>I had every intention last night, after several nights in a row out on the town, of staying home and resting.  I have laundry that needs to be done, and various household chores that I have neglected for the past few days.  On my way home, I stopped for a cup of coffee, and a kind soul in the record store next to the coffee shop offered me two free tickets to see Elvis Costello that night.  When someone offers you free tickets to see Elvis Costello, you take the tickets and go to the show.  So I did.  In my heartbroken condition, listening to Elvis live was cathartic.  Elvis knows just how I feel, the scorned lover, the angry bitter ex-boyfriend.  Thanks Elvis.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had about a week to process the information avalanche I experienced at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Devcon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I took a lot away from the conference.  Much of it was technical in nature, coding techniques, the use of the new technology in ColdFusion MX and Flash MX.  Some of it was soft information, and relationships with incredibly smart people I would never have met otherwise.  I would say, however, that the one thing that will stick with me the most is the concept of Rich Internet Applications.  That is Macromedia&rsquo;s term, not mine.  In my mind, what this is really is the natural evolution of Internet technology in a way that it now supports true client server type interaction.  Now I should say, before you start sending me email that says I am wrong about this and that it is possible to create client serverish interactions using the DOM and DHTML, I know about that stuff.  I know it really well because I have been working on the browser based rewrite of a manufacturing ERP system for the last six months.  There are a ton of limitations doing this stuff with DHTML, not the least of which is that HTML based UI&rsquo;s just are not the best way to visually display some kinds of information, or the best way for users to interact with that information.  Flash and Flash Remoting will give us the ability to do much of this stuff in an easier way.  Cold Fusion Components will allow us to create objects with methods that are reusable, and this will lead to a more object oriented approach to our system development.  I just wish we were using the MX platform now as I struggle with the creation of a manufacturing item creation interface.  So that&rsquo;s what I took away in a nutshell.</p>

			 <p>The Democrats got stomped yesterday, and the Republicans are now very comfortably in control of the country.  While I choose not to directly associate myself with either party, I&rsquo;ve always been more comfortable with the way our government was being run when each party had control of one of the major entities.  I think that, from my perspective, the stomping the Democrats took has a lot to do with the lack of leadership and coherent messages from the Party itself.  There were openings that they definitely did not execute on.  The Republicans also seemed to outspend the Democrats.  Perhaps they will get their shit together now.  I doubt it though.  I still find myself wishing for a legitimate third party.  The barrier to entry makes this task a near impossible one.</p>

			 <p>After exercising my right to vote last night and taking a brief nap, I headed out, by myself, to the Amon Tobin show at the Echo Lounge in East Atlanta.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bonobo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the first DJ up, and he rocked.  His internationally influenced jazzy hip hop style got my feet a tapping.  Next up was Strictly Kev of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DJ Food<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fame.  I don&rsquo;t know if I have ever seen a DJ who kept himself busier, lining one mix up after another and knocking them all down.  Then there was a set, which was more scratching oriented, from P-Love.  I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with him prior to the show, but he was really good, and technically solid.  Finally, Amon Tobin hit the stage manning his Final Scrath Pro setup.  He was great, creating these beat driven soundscapes that are really hard to describe.  I had to leave before the end of his set, it being a school night and all, but I left wanting to stay.</p>

			 <p>One thing I haven&rsquo;t seen mentioned in others' coverage of Devcon was the presence of Wi-Fi throughout the conference area.  Macromedia had set up at least two Cisco wireless routers, as far as I could tell from using my Stumbler, that covered most of the session rooms even for my range limited TiBook. During the General Sessions, I discovered that other people using Mac OS X 10.2 were logged into the network and had their iChat apps launched with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rendezvous<!-- raw HTML omitted --> enabled.  This meant that we all had the ability to discuss the keynotes with other people who were in the room without actually having to know who else in the room had a laptop and wi-fi.  This was very interesting to me, even though the actual communications weren&rsquo;t terribly useful this time.</p>

Friday night, I got a chance to see one of the most innovative DJ&rsquo;s I have ever heard, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Z-Trip<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  He mixes music that you would never expect to hear a dj mix, and I think you just might have to see it to believe it.

Sunday, another trip to the Georgia Dome to see the Falcons win followed by the chance to see a friend perform some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hilarious inventive comedy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The moral of the story is that I am trying very hard to stay busy, with limited success.  The quick back story is that things ended recently between the woman I have been dating for the last seven years and I.  Try as I might, I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about her, missing her, mourning what has been lost, and wondering where life is going to take me now.  I know that, with time, the pain I am in right now will pass, but while my mind is ready to move on, my heart just isn&rsquo;t yet.  It&rsquo;s very sad.  I thought that going away to Orlando would help me take my mind off things.  Somehow I managed to forget that the last couple of times I have been there for pleasure it has been with her.  It seemed that, everywhere I went, memories kept popping out.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, I went to see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Atlanta Falcons<!-- raw HTML omitted --> play for the first time this season.  All I can say is that Michael Vick is an incredible athlete.  Seeing him play gives me the same feeling that I got watching Michael Jordan early in his career.  He is capable of things that no other player at his position can physically do.  I really think, if he can stay healthy, that his career will be one that raises the Falcon franchise to a whole new level.</p>

			 <p>A bunch of us went to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Atlanta Thrashers' home opener<!-- raw HTML omitted --> last night.  I had a great time, despite the loss in overtime to Florida.  I definitely plan on going to more games this year, but I can&rsquo;t believe how expensive tickets are.  We had decent seats, and they cost $60 each.  That means that it cost the family of four sitting in front of me $240 to attend before snacks or anything else.  I really think that pro sports have gotten out of control.  After the game, Joan Jett played on the ice.  She sounded great.</p>

			 <p>On a related note to the post below, I think that, due to the community aspects of blogging, it would be possible to write a piece of software that generated conversations that could occur between various bloggers when they meet and talk.  Not that bloggers as a group are limited in topics of discussion, but that, knowing a particular blogger, and their daily surf lists it is possible to figure out both their general interests are and what their inputs have been over the last few days. You could use a pattern algorithm to then match the inputs and interests between the group, and probably accurately predict what the topics of conversation would be.  This comes from having the sorts of conversations that I expected to have with Todd and Nathan.</p>

They talked about their site, team, community, and process.  It was interesting to hear them talk about their redesign that launched over the summer, how they are building community through the use of their Orbit system, and especially the animation process they go through to get hand drawn animation into Flash.  The one single thing that struck me is how much careful planning seemed go to into their community development.  They even enlisted the help of an economics professor to help them design their &ldquo;points&rdquo; system.    Unfortunately, there was no <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Samurai Jack<!-- raw HTML omitted --> swag to be had.</p>

			 <p>eWeek: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Microsoft Adds XDocs to Office Family<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  There is this quote from one of the beta testers of XDocs on the first page of the article; &ldquo;The validation capability within XDocs enables us to check our data against criteria that we have set, improving the accuracy of data entry.&rdquo;  I don&rsquo;t see how this would be a selling point for a product.  We already have an easy to build form mechanism that allows us to validate against virtually any criteria imaginable, it&rsquo;s called a Web page.  In my current project, we are replacing a company&rsquo;s legacy ERP system, which does everything from supply chain management to accounting, with a browser based system.  ERP systems are form intensive, believe me, I should know as I have been developing an application module for the last two weeks that has hundreds of unique pieces of data related to a single item.  So I am unable to grasp what sort of value this XDocs product delivers to Microsoft&rsquo;s customer base.  We already have tight Web/Database integration through several middleware products, you take your pick, and virtually all of them have solid XML support now. I just don&rsquo;t get it.  Why solve a problem that already has a fantastic solution?  (Microsoft XDocs Page is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.)</p>

			 <p>I was thinking this morning about stories from my life, small experiences that changed me and have stuck with me which, from the outside, might not seem that important in the grand scheme of things.  For some reason, something that happened to me in junior high school popped into my mind.  Oddly, I can&rsquo;t figure out why, because I don&rsquo;t think it taught me anything that I refer to daily.  It was my eighth grade year, and I was in science class.  We were studying <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Centrifugal force<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Mr. Sagnella, my science teacher, was my favorite teacher.  He asked for someone to come to the front of the class to help him with the demonstration.  I volunteered.  I went up to the front of the class, and he handed me a bucket full of water.  To demonstrate the power of the force, I was to spin the bucket around.  No water would come out of the bucket due to the centrifugal force.  No water that is, until the bucket attempted to occupy the same space at the same time as the 100 gallon fishtank that was directly behind me.  The tank shattered, the bucket went flying, and I stood at the center where the force of the water from the fishtank and the remaining water in the bucket met.  Needless to say, I was &ldquo;that kid who shattered the fishtank&rdquo; for several months.  In my professional life, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever given a presentation or demo that has gone worse. I&rsquo;ll have to keep that in mind the next time I get up to speak in public.</p>

While this is the end of an era, a goodbye to a friend, I don&rsquo;t feel particularly sad about Mac OS 9&rsquo;s passing.  I removed Mac OS 9 from my machine when I installed Jaguar.  All of the applications I use on a daily basis have made the jump now, and Mac OS X is completely superior to Mac OS 9 in terms of both performance on the same hardware and stability.  The addition of the chewy Unix underpinnings, and the software that has accompanied it, has actually meant that I am also using my Windows laptop less and less as well.  If you use the Mac OS, I urge you to embrace the winds of change rather than fight them.  You won&rsquo;t be sorry, I promise.</p>

He asked if I had ever heard of the book and was quite excited to tell me that bump.net was not only mentioned in the book, but that, on page 62 of the book, there was even a screen capture of bump.net used as an example.  Wow, that&rsquo;s incredibly cool, and I&rsquo;m not certain I&rsquo;ve done anything to deserve it..  It&rsquo;s especially cool because I have so much respect for Matt, Meg, and Paul.  All three of them are impressive people, both online and in person.  Thanks.</p>

			 <p>I migrated my TiBook over to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac OS 10.2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> last week.  It took longer than normal because I wanted to reformat the hard drive and that meant backing everything up and then having to re-install everything.  This was complicated by the fact that my MS Office V.X CD is AWOL, and I&rsquo;m going to have to order another one I guess.  I&rsquo;m finding Jaguar to be faster in all the right places, and with so many improvements that I wouldn&rsquo;t even try to go into them here.  I&rsquo;m also using the just released <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iCal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, despite reports on the Web that it is buggy, and the complaints that they forgot to offer the Canadian holidays, I think it&rsquo;s well done, especially for a first effort.  Some of the data entry stuff is not as intuitive as I would normally expect.  For instance, there is no way to attach any kind of note to a To Do task.  Normally, my to do items need additional information with them in order for me to get them done, and I like putting that stuff together when I enter them.</p>

			 <p>The return of regular season NFL football last night was a welcome diversion for me.  Despite the fact that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my Giants lost<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the game gave me new hope that the squad will be better this year, especially with the addition of Jeremy Shockey.  It definitely opened the door for the rest of the pass offense, and Amani Toomer&rsquo;s numbers bear that out.  I submit that the game was lost due to the calling of the prevent defense, and bad clock management in the fourth quarter.  My co-worker argues that the Giants lost the game because they scored fewer points than the 49ers.</p>

			 <p>I have a huge Pecan tree in my backyard.  Pecan trees bear nuts every other year, and over the last month it has been consistently dropping nuts.  About half of them drop right onto the roof of my house, making quite a bit of noise in the process, and another quarter of them seem to find their way into my pool, which is a total pain in the ass.  Unfortunately, the tree is a little too close to my house for comfort.  Pecan trees have this habit of dropping limbs, and with the size of the tree, I&rsquo;m concerned that this could cause some major damage to my domicile.  So I&rsquo;m now torn between finding a way to keep the old man around, and just removing the tree altogether.  I guess we&rsquo;ll find out this afternoon, when the tree expert comes out to have a look.  It doesn&rsquo;t look good for the old man though.</p>

			 <p>So I&rsquo;m now back at work after a fantastic ten day trip to Maine and Nova Scotia.  If you sent me an email or voice message over the last week, it may take me a day or two to get back to you.  All I can say is that I loved Nova Scotia.  It&rsquo;s a great place to take a vacation and the countryside is beautiful and unmolested.  There are plenty of great outdoor activities, and we did a bunch of them.  I&rsquo;ll write more about this later tonight, and I&rsquo;ll be putting some pictures up as well.  I loved Maine nearly as much, but it&rsquo;s a bit more touristy and built up.</p>

			 <p>One other thing that I have been thinking about today, in order to relieve the stress of my break in, involves super heroes and liability insurance.  If you were a super hero, what kind of liability insurance would you need to carry?  In fact, how could you even find a company that would insure you and what sort of huge premium would you have to pay?  Imagine Superman fighting a villain in Metropolis, destroying buildings, homes, and city property in the process but putting the baddy away.  He would then have to defend himself in all manner of lawsuits.  In our society, he couldn&rsquo;t count on the good will of the citizens of Metropolis, and that he was fighting for the common good, he would get sued regardless of this fact.  It would almost make being a super hero not a worthwhile endeavor.  You would spend ten times as much time settling all of the suits as you would fighting crime.</p>

			 <p>I went to see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Branden Hall<!-- raw HTML omitted --> speak to our local Macromedia User&rsquo;s Group last night.  He talked about consuming Web Services with Flash, which is quite easy to set up, and also about the new Flash Communications Server, with which it is surprisingly easy to build applications.  I really like the direction that Macromedia has taken with their Flash product line, but I sometimes feel like developers in the Flash community and Macromedia people, don&rsquo;t get what they have with Cold Fusion.  This is somewhat frustrating to me.  One example of this is their plan to phase out the Cold Fusion specific developer tools in favor of Dreamweaver.  I&rsquo;m not saying that Dreamweaver is a bad tool, but a one size fits all approach to development tools rarely works, especially when you have an audience of developers with skill sets and needs as diverse as those that the Macromedia customer base now includes.  I think all of this points to a cultural split inside of Macromedia that somewhat mirrors the two companies prior to the Allaire-Macromedia merger.  I thought this after talking to some Macromedia folks at SXSW this year, and as time goes on, I think this more and more.  Well, that&rsquo;s just my observation for now.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Safari service<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the last few days on a trial basis(they offer a 14 day trial.)  For someone like me, who buys a lot of computer books and is constantly referring to them on various projects, this service, which lets you subscribe to ten books online and read them from any internet connected machine, is ideal.  It saves me from having to carry books to and from work every day, and the search feature means that I can see which books contain information relevant to my current problem or project.  In the three days that I have been using the service, I have already done this at least ten times.  The books available are not confined to the valuable O&rsquo;Reilly books, but there are books from a bunch of technology publishing companies.  At $14.99 a month for ten books, I think this service is a bargain, but I think they could do us all one better.  I think the service would be even better if, when you buy a book from O&rsquo;Reilly that is offered on Safari, you should get a serial number or unique indentifier that can be used to activate that book on Safari at no charge.  That way I wouldn&rsquo;t be paying for books that I want paper copies of twice, I would get used to using the service so that I would want more books that I hadn&rsquo;t bought paper copies of.  A win-win in my opinion,  I wonder who at O&rsquo;Reilly I should send an email to with this suggestion?</p>

			 <p>I thought long and hard about expressing this sentiment.  I can&rsquo;t help it, I want to talk about this subject even if I feel I have to do it in the most general terms I can.  At the same time, I don&rsquo;t want to come off as chiding the folks involved, I&rsquo;m certainly no better or worse than any of them and often times I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m worse.  I am tired, very tired, of all of the noxious bickering that I&rsquo;ve been seeing in the Weblog &ldquo;community.&rdquo;  It does a disservice to the medium, and it does a disservice to to the people involved.  It also does a fantastic job of snuffing out valuable conversation.

			 <p>I hear a lot of complaining/whining from the Mac camp since the keynote address last week.  The restructure of iTools into the fee based .Mac service and the full price charge for the new version of the Operating System (Jaguar) have some people up in arms.  I don&rsquo;t doubt that the reality of the situation is that Apple knew that these moves would not please a good chunk of folks.  I think the reality here is just that times are not so great in the PC sector, and that companies need to squeeze out revenue wherever possible.  Apple looks at possible revenue streams that do not include the purchase of hardware, and these two are pretty obvious choices.  I think if they started charging for the iApps, they would have defeated the purpose of having those apps to begin with, and probably made people even more angry than they are now.  Servers for something like iTools aren&rsquo;t cheap, and even though it really is not Apple&rsquo;s core business to be in a business like this, the opportunity was there.  Most of their forays into territory like this (remember eWorld?) have ended in failure, so I would say &ldquo;stay tuned&rdquo;.   I think people should recognize that, in the climate that they are in, Apple needs to do whatever they can to sustain/create revenue, and this includes charging for something they probably wanted to keep free.  Personally, I could care less about a mac.com email address, but I&rsquo;m not the Mac-bigot that I once was.  I&rsquo;m mostly using Windows XP these days, and NT at the office for software reasons.  Mac OS X is brilliant, I love it, and I wish that I could use it at the office, but it&rsquo;s not sooo much better than Windows XP.  Well, just some thoughts I wanted to post last week but couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t really been missing the last ten days, just busy and a bit under the weather.  I missed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave<!-- raw HTML omitted --> online while he was gone.  He&rsquo;s trying hard to quit smoking now.  I&rsquo;ve tried, and I&rsquo;ve even blogged the attempts.  The longest I&rsquo;ve made it is a year.  I&rsquo;ve since realized that, if I&rsquo;m going to really quit smoking, I&rsquo;m not going to be able to drink socially anymore.  Not even a beer while watcing the game or a glass of wine at a dinner party.  Every time I have tried and failed, it has either been related to stress, or the relapse has come as a result of some drunken night of partying with friends.  I&rsquo;m happy he is back and that everything seems to be okay, and I wish him the best of luck in his attempts at cessation.  I don&rsquo;t think anyone who hasn&rsquo;t been addicted to cigarettes can really appreciate just how hard it is to quit.  Even in my own peer group, I find people leering at me when I mention that I have tried to quit and failed.  These folks don&rsquo;t have the perspective to really be leering, it&rsquo;s so hard that I would venture that most people wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it the first time.  I&rsquo;m trying to get some house stuff done right now, and hoping to get some template work done tonight on the CF Blog site.</p>

In my opinion, Shaq is a more dominant player than even his Airness was.  Next season, he&rsquo;ll have the chance to make it four straight.</p>

Between Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, the Matrix movies and all the comic book movies that have/are being made, we might just be in the golden age of science fiction/fantasy movies.  I wonder which of the major cyberpunk works will be the first to be made into a major motion picture.  I haven&rsquo;t heard much about the Neuromancer movie that was being made lately.

I think that this is part of what made the Web so attractive to me initially.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ReadyMade<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has to be the most amusing new magazine I&rsquo;ve come across in a long time.  I loved the first issue, and the second issue is out now.  I would describe it as the magazine that Martha Stewart would come out with if she was actually cool and if she had a sense of humor about things.  You should find this magazine, and then read it.</p>

			 <p>Well, I&rsquo;m back today after a fun weekend in Northern California with my main squeeze.  It was a short trip for the amount of flying involved, but I&rsquo;d never been to Monterey and Carmel before.  I enjoyed both, but liked Carmel much more, it&rsquo;s less trashy and touristy, although it is still quite touristy.  Today, I&rsquo;m recovering from flying back on the redeye.</p>

This afternoon, I went out back to skim the pool, and floating in the middle of my pool was a baby chipmunk clinging to one of the pool noodles for dear life.  I&rsquo;m not sure how long he had been floating there, but he seemed like he had been there a while.  I fished him out and dried him off, hopefully he will have learned a valuable lesson that many of his peers never learned: stay way from the ocean in the middle of the backyard.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Attack of the Clones<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was incredible.  I won&rsquo;t spoil anything here, but I heartily endorse it.  As anyone who has been reading this site since 1997 or 1998 knows, I&rsquo;m quite <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Yoda fan<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and his role in this movie was fantastic.   This movie was much much better than the last one.  I can only imagine how much this movie will gross at the box office. Update: Well, I slept off my midnight movie hangover, and now I&rsquo;m reading what others thought of this movie.  I&rsquo;m really surprised at the mixed reviews this movie got.  It was fun, it didn&rsquo;t take itself too seriously, and it seems like a lot of other folks are taking it too seriously.   I almost think that there is no way that George Lucas can win on the review front.  On the other hand, there is almost no way he can lose on the dollar front, and what do you suppose is more important to him?</p>

The strange thing is that we have had plenty of rain over the last few weeks, so thirst shouldn&rsquo;t be a motivation for them to jump in the pool.  I just don&rsquo;t understand what could possibly be so depressing about being a chipmunk that would make them want to end their little chipmunk lives.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave talks about iChat and Apple.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  I think people look at these things the wrong way.  Yes, Apple is releasing a chat client with the next version of Mac OS X.  The complaint seems to be that with their iSoftware applications, Apple is entering the space that independent developers are already in, and stomping all over their efforts.  On the other hand, most chat software is free.  Having said that, Apple doesn&rsquo;t have the history of taking advantage of undocumented system features with their apps like Microsoft has with Office.  They tend to expose the same interfaces for third parties that they use themselves.  So, my conclusion is that a third party chat application with better features does have the opportunity to play in the market.  These built in applications, iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and the online application suite iTools, tend to be best of breed applications.  They make the platform more attractive to consumers, without a doubt.  I think that the long term gain of market share by delivering applications like these to Apple customers outwieghs the negatives.  I do wonder, however, where the line should be drawn.  By continuing development of all of these applications, is Apple losing it&rsquo;s focus?  How many of these applications does it makes sense for them to invest in?  Finally, god forbid they decide to discontinue development on one of these applications if developers have decided to vacate that space.</p>

It might just be me, but I think this just might send the wrong message to this group of users.  I also think that, if their preview didn&rsquo;t work on Windows XP, they would be rewrapping it today.</p>

			 <p>Geez, that was a short preview.  There&rsquo;s some sort of problem with both the Dreamweaver and Flash MX preview versions that I have installed on my Mac OS X machine.  They expired after the first time I ran them rather than on June 7th  and in 90 days respectively.  There is a thread in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Macromedia Preview<!-- raw HTML omitted --> forums that deals with the issue, and the fact that they are aware of it, but that they aren&rsquo;t sure what causes it so there is no fix yet.  So no preview for me anymore.  Damn, I was having fun.</p>

			 <p>I think that I am experiencing Macromedia MX overload.  Having all this new stuff at once has made me like a kid in a candy store, but now I have the ensuing tummy ache.  I take back the majority of what I said in my rant on Friday.  Dreamweaver MX appears to make me want to buy it when it is released.  I don&rsquo;t say this lightly, I&rsquo;ve been a BBEdit addict for the last six years of my life.  What they&rsquo;ve done with it makes it a much closer Mac replacement for Cold Fusion Studio than anything else.  I&rsquo;ve got Cold Fusion MX running on a server here at the Bump clubhouse.  By all appearances, I&rsquo;m impressed and want very much to do real live work with it and the Flash remoting stuff.  Anyway, I&rsquo;m a little bleary eyed right now. Time for some shuteye.</p>

			 <p>I had an interesting moment this morning.  At least to me.  I couldn&rsquo;t remember when the last time I rebooted my Ti Powerbook that is running Mac OS X was.  I fired up the terminal, typed &ldquo;uptime&rdquo; and discovered that my machine hadn&rsquo;t been rebooted in 12 days.  This on the machine I use for email, web browsing, games, and just about everything that doesn&rsquo;t absolutely require the use of my Sony laptop or my other machine that is still running mac OS 9.  This might not seem like that long to some, but to people who are still using Mac OS 9, this would be an eternity to have your machine not crash or have to reboot it after a software install.  Progress.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->USATODAY.com - Piracy pillages music industry<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Yet another big newspaper piece that does not really explore this issue fully.  My views are quite evident to longtime readers. I buy music, and I want to be able to use it anywhere.  There are lots of issues with the music companies, including the ridiculous pricing of cd&rsquo;s today.  At the same time, I admit there is an issue here with piracy.  People who can damn well afford to pay for the music they listen to are making copies of cd&rsquo;s for each other.  I was at a friends house last week, he&rsquo;s a consultant for a company that does ERP software implementations.  He was giving a copy of the Moulin Rouge soundtrack that he had made for another friend  of mine who works in the same business.  These are people who make six figures plus, not starving college students, not people who are frustrated with the lack of digitally distributed music.  This hammered home for me that this really is a serious issue that is not the simple set of issues normally presented by the &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; crowd.  Sure, I might buy more music because of the exposure to it online, but others will simply take what they want regardless of morals and ethics.  Having said that, the music industry cannot point at digital copying alone for its woes, and their statistics prove nothing.</p>

The band was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Live on Arrival<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an Atlanta hip hop group that has been around for several years.  Somehow I had never run into them before.  They were solid, a couple of MC&rsquo;s, sometimes joined by others, and a band consisting of drums, bass, guitar, two keyboardists, and a dj.  One word popped into my head while I was watching them: Legitimate.  Really well designed and executed rhymes, and musically they are on a soulish tip.  They sort of reminded me at times of the Goats, one of my favorite hip hop groups from Philly that also played with a live band.   I snapped a bunch of pictures which you will find <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I&rsquo;ll definitely be at their shows from here on out.</p>

			 <p>Good people can do bad things, and bad people are quite capable of doing good things at times.  Sometimes, when a bad person does something that wasn&rsquo;t intended as a good thing, the results nonetheless are good results.  Also, when a good person tries to do something good, they can cause bad results.  As a result of this information set, I rarely will condemn a person&rsquo;s actions across the board.  I get frustrated sometimes, that the binary nature of people causes them to do this, to condemn someone across the board.  It gets tiring, hearing essentially the same thing from someone over and over again.  Just a meandering thought, but one that I seem to be thinking a lot recently.</p>

Finally, there&rsquo;s not a new piece of information in this article anywhere.  No conclusions drawn, no recommendations made.  Where&rsquo;s the beef?</p>

			 <p>Okay, so I was distracted by the NCAA basketball tournament yesterday.  Considering that the Final Four is right here in good old Atlanta this year, I figured I&rsquo;d pay attention.

There are more games today, but perhaps if I get the TV Tuner installed in the one machine back here in my office, I won&rsquo;t have that problem today.  I&rsquo;m finally beginning to feel normal again post-SXSW.  This is accompanied by the realization that I left my house a mess, and so I have returned to a mess, and that needs to be dealt with.

I&rsquo;m quite mentally and socially tired, but I&rsquo;ll sit down tomorrow and write something up about the people, places, panels, and parties.  I&rsquo;m thinking that it should be with a minimum of name dropping.  That would probably be good, but difficult to avoid.  A couple of quick observations though.  1)  There are a real lot of bloggers.  2)  When confronted with groups of people larger than fifteen, I am seemingly unable to remember anyone&rsquo;s name.

			 <p>I was watching an episode of Real Sports on HBO last night.  Among their reports was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a story about gymclass dodgeball<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Apparently, there is an increasing movement among schools in this country to ban the game of dodgeball.  The rationale is that it is &ldquo;an excessively violent lesson to be teaching children.&rdquo;  I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin reacting to this.  I loved dodgeball in gym class as a kid, and I was far from the star athlete of my class.  As far as it being an excessively violent lesson, there are plenty of other, more violent, things that kids are exposed to these days.  It&rsquo;s a sport, and, win or lose, I think that competitive sports teach kids valuable lessons.    It&rsquo;s amazing to me with all the crap kids have to negotiate through in life these days that some fool is using his precious spare time to fight the scourge of dodgeball.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking Grim at the Grammys<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;The generally dismal quality of America&rsquo;s mass-marketed pop music is an esthetic national emergency.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  This person is looking in the wrong place.  There&rsquo;s plenty of great music coming out, but it&rsquo;s not from a boy band or a teenage diva.  Mass-marketed pop music has been bad for decades, maybe even forever.  I&rsquo;m finding solace primarily in the Turntablism movement and the Electronic music community currently.  Bands like Gorrilaz are products of these movements without actually being a part of them.  I&rsquo;d trade fifty Britney&rsquo;s for Dan the Automator any day.  Some of the other music that has meant a lot to me are artists that have left or been forced out of major label America, like Aimee Mann.  The bottom line is that music is art, it&rsquo;s self expression, not just another product, not just another dishwashing liquid or pair of khakis.  Without that self expression being genuine, there&rsquo;s no emotion.  Whether that emotion is torment or bliss, it&rsquo;s the experience of it, and the story that it tells through words and emotions that make it so important to me.  Most of the time when the majors luck into an artist like this, it&rsquo;s because they threw a whole truckload of shit, and, while most of it sucked, one or two artists shone through.  For every Jeff Buckley or Radiohead, there are a few hundred artists that were either mediocre or just plain sucked.  Perhaps I am being an optimist, but that&rsquo;s how things look from where I stand, and no amount of file swapping is going to change it.</p>

			 <p>Macromedia finally annouced <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flash MX<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  What is up with all these software companies switching over to letters for software versions?  Confusing, if you ask me.  One thing that the site doesn&rsquo;t tell you, but should be public knowledge, is that the new version of Cold Fusion that will come on the heels of this version of Flash will have an entire API that is dedicated to Flash integration.  You will be able to use Cold Fusion as your application logic and to manage state, and use Flash as your UI layer.  This should be scary stuff for the providers of other Web Application servers because it&rsquo;s also written in Java.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rob Fahrni&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> project to get Visio rendering OPML files into diagrams reminds me why I don&rsquo;t use Visio when I&rsquo;m doing sitemap work for Web sites.  Instead, I use a product called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inspiration<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The main reason for this is that Inspiration has a built in outliner that lets you define hierarchical relationships and do all your typing outside of the actual diagram mode.  This makes the labor intensive process of defining sitemaps for large sites that have more than 200 pages quite a bit easier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious what tools other people use for this sitemapping/information design part of the Web site building process.  I believe that I discovered Inspiration via one of Kelly Goto&rsquo;s talks at a Web Design conference I attended in Atlanta.  What do you use?</p>

Not so much in talent(although you could argue that as well), but more in the fact that the US played a much more difficult and physical game yesterday.  It&rsquo;s a physical sport, and they were running out of gas by the end of the game last night.  Go USA!!</p>

I&rsquo;ve tried running OmniWeb (no css support to speak of) and OPera on my Mac OS X boxes, but neither is as compatible with the sites I visit as Internet Explorer.  Of course, the reason the sites are more compatible with Internet Explorer is because more people use Internet Explorer than any other browser.  So the people who design the sites test them against Internet Explorer.  We need another browser to get at least 30% market share very badly.</p>

			 <p>One more comment about my hockey watching.  The IOC, very wisely, won&rsquo;t stop the games for American style tv timeouts.  As a result, NBC takes commercial breaks whenever they feel like there is a stoppage in play.  At least once in the last week, this has meant we have missed goal scoring plays.  I understand that without the commercials, there would be no television coverage, but at the same time, the way they are doing things is really frustrating to the fan.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moodstats<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a cross platform app, from the Kaliber 10000 folks, for tracking your mood and other daily measurements of your life, and a journal application.

			 <p>Yesterday, in between bouts of being frustrated with my computer equipment and software, I watched all four Olympic hockey games that were televised.  I&rsquo;ve only missed one or two of the televised games since the start of the games.  I can tell you that, with a couple of exceptions, this is the best televised hockey I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and the best games are ahead of us still.  Who would have imagined that Sweden would kick Canada&rsquo;s butt?  Who would have thought that Belarus would then beat Sweden?  The upcoming US vs. Russia game, twenty two years ago to the day from the upset in 1980, will be hard played.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I, Cringely | The Power of X<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Another essay extolling the virtues of Apple entering the Intel based OS market.  I don&rsquo;t see it.  In my opinion, despite the fact that it might be good for Microsoft to see some real competition on the desktop, it would be the death of Apple.  Apple is a much smaller company than Microsoft.  Apple is not capable, at this point at supporting the sheer volume of hardware available on the Intel platform.  I could be wrong about this, but I don&rsquo;t think so.  Apple&rsquo;s only real credible advantage is the cohesion between their hardware and software.  I just don&rsquo;t think they could make as much money changing their business plan to a software only one. They are a hardware company.  How many companies can you name that made a huge switch like that successfully?</p>

			 <p>Long day here at the Bump Clubhouse.  I decided to finally install the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sonnet Technologies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ZIF/G4 upgrade card in my Blue and White tower that I am using as my home fileserver/home Apache server.  I bought the card open boxed about two months ago, but hadn&rsquo;t the time or the inclination to install until today.  It was such a good deal that I couldn&rsquo;t pass it up.  Well, lo and behold, I took the card out of the box and it isn&rsquo;t a ZIF G4 at all, but a PCI G3, someone had pulled the ole switcheroo  on Microcenter.  I took it up there, and they let me return it after all.  Even though I bought it in November.  Good story of customer service and a big up to Marchand and Jim over at the Marrietta store for taking care of me.  So now I have a much faster server.  Yay.</p>

			 <p>Oh, and not to take anything away from the Russian skaters who did win the medal, but the Canadian skaters who ended up with the Silver got screwed out of the Gold.  Everyone who watched the broadcast, and seemingly everyone in the arena but the judges knew it.   It&rsquo;s a shame for the sport of figure skating really.  There are people who don&rsquo;t watch it except for the once every four year Olympic competitions.  I, for one, have a hard time with sports where judges determine the outcome to begin with.  Referees or umpires are one thing, they can have some effect on the outcome, but when judges have enough leeway to make someone who obviously gave an inferior performance win, I take exception.</p>

			 <p>Just a quick note about my blogger entry import project.  It&rsquo;s true that I have imported all of my blogger entries and my pre-blogger entries into Radio with Userland&rsquo;s help, but Userland will be releasing the code and docs for this process once they have cleaned things up, not me.  Please wait until they do so because anything you get from me right now won&rsquo;t be documented well.  I imagine that they will be getting it out in the next couple of days.  Not that I mind answering emails on the subject, but that I would prefer that everyone get this code with good documentation and support from Userland.</p>

			 <p>Updates will be sporadic today, as I&rsquo;m traveling to Las Vegas this afternoon for a weekend of relaxation and fun.  I still have to pack and get the house ready for the cat sitter.  I, of course, put that off until the last minute.  I believe that the hotel where we are staying has high speed Internet access in the rooms, so I should get some updating in this weekend in the mornings.  I&rsquo;m hoping to finish the design here in the next few days, it would already be done if I could natively run my graphics apps in Mac OS X.</p>

			 <p>My father announced his retirement this afternoon, and called me about it today.  I&rsquo;m glad it was his decision, and is what he wants.  He&rsquo;s a great guy, and it&rsquo;s pretty lame that I don&rsquo;t tell him that more often.  When I look at myself, I think most of the really good stuff that&rsquo;s there is due to him in one way or another.  I worshipped him as a kid.  He may not have known it at the time.  As I got older, I found myself time and time again judging myself by standards that were set by him.  Here&rsquo;s wishing you the best in your retirement Dad.  You certainly have worked hard as long as I&rsquo;ve known you:-)</p>

This involved turning my pre-Blogger posts from November 1997 to March 2000 into XML files.  Once I got there, the work we did this week with Blogger import took over.  Now everyone has easy access to all the meaningless drivel I wrote back then in addition to the drivel I&rsquo;m turning out now.  I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s just what the Internet needs.</p>

			 <p>MacSlash: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sony vs. Apple For The Digital Hub Title<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  I a lot to say about this.  I have, almost exclusively bought Somy home electronic components over the last two years.  You can count among that number my Sony Wega XBR Television, my Playstation 2, my portable and console Minidisc players/recorders, my DVD player, and my receiver/amplifier.  I also have both Apple and Sony laptops, and a Sony Clie handheld.  I think that, if these two companies actually teamed up, they would both benefit.  It&rsquo;s doubtful that would ever happen.  I think a more realistic competition comparison here is actually Sony vs. Microsoft.  Look beyond the obvious battle for game consoles here, and you will see that Microsoft has plans for the living room that directly compete with Sony.</p>

AOL is providing a service, they own the servers, they pay for the bandwidth.  This stuff is not free.  It&rsquo;s up to them to decide if what they are providing is an open network that people can write other clients for or not.  The only real chance they have to recoup their costs is through pushing advertising out to the client software.  Now, if they were smart, they would write an API that allowed other clients to become certified for their network which required the ability to push ads out to the client.  Then they wouldd get the best of both worlds, other people would be doing some of the innovation work for them, and they would still get the advertising revenue from the third party clients.</p>

			 <p>Strange thing this afternoon.  I&rsquo;m more of a dog person really than a cat person.(Don&rsquo;t tell Loofa that please.)  Normally dogs love me, and even dogs that are generally unfriendly to other people seem to warm up to me right away.  I was walking acrosss a parking lot this afternoon, and this woman was talking to someone and holding her two dogs on leashes.  As I walked by, one of them strained to the end of its leash wagging it&rsquo;s tail.  I took this to mean that he/she wanted to say hello, so I took a step closer.  The dog immediately took a mouthful of my shirt and began trying to bite me.  I was stunned, and the dogs owner also seem stunned.  Anyway, the dog put two little teeth holes in my shirt.  I&rsquo;m now doubting that dogs like me.</p>

			 <p>I re-installed Windows XP on my Sony Vaio yesterday.  I have say that I&rsquo;m very impressed with the speed of the new OS so far.  I originally did an install right over Windows ME, which was a mistake.  A clean install, as painful as that can be, seems to be the way to go with it.  At times, especially when Web surfing, it makes my Mac OS X machine, which is comparable in speed and configuration, look sluggish.  Having said that, I suspect that this is because Internet Explorer for Mac OS X isn&rsquo;t the fastest app on the planet.</p>

			 <p>Those of you that have been tuned into this site have probably noticed that I have been publishing with a lot more vigor than normal the last couple of weeks.  I originally thought that it was the return on my broadband connection that was making me post more, but I&rsquo;m thinking along different lines now.  I think that my interest in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Radio Userland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it&rsquo;s desktop news aggregator, and RadioExpress have been responsible for my renewed interest in my site.  I do not mean this as a universal endorsement of Radio over the other tools available out there, but that it is more Mac oriented than the other blog publishing tools despite being cross platform.  It runs on Mac OS X perfectly.  It is a platform for futher development if I ever have the time to do it.  Finally, I like that my publishing data is right here locally and that I can publish in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->two<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->places<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with a single tool.</p>

			 <p>I read Harry Turtledove&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Guns of the South<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over the weekend.  It&rsquo;s based on the premise that the South actually wins the Civil War due to the intervention of some time traveling folks who give them AK-47&rsquo;s.  I actually liked it, and I think that it was very different in it&rsquo;s portrayal of folks like Robert E. Lee than I originally expected.  I&rsquo;m ashamed to say that I have stayed away from Mr. Turtledove&rsquo;s books in the past because I thought that the covers looked hokey, but now I&rsquo;m going to read some of his other works.  So I guess I do judge books by their covers.</p>

Adding an alarm clock feature would also be nice, so you could have a travel alarm clock with the purchase of some small portable speakers.  Speaking of which, does anyone have experience with any of the small portable speakers on the market?

			 <p>It&rsquo;s raining here again.  Of course, it was seventy degrees here today, so I don&rsquo;t have too much room for complaints.  It does seem, however, that the rain is conspiring against my getting any yard work done around the house.  Not that this place doesn&rsquo;t have plenty of stuff that needs to be done inside.  I am very much in need of stuff to hang on the walls in most of my house.  I have apartment quality wall hangings that I want to phase out, and so I haven&rsquo;t hung any of them.  I did hang some of my animation cels.  (I have a particularly good Scooby Doo and Shaggy cel with the actual production background.)  These, however, give the house a certain childish vibe that I do not want to foster.  Patience, I guess, is a virtue.</p>

			 <p>After getting laid off in October, I have spent the ensuing months getting my act together and evaluating my life.  I also spent a real lot of time with my family, and a smaller amount of time fighting with my previous employer over my severance and accrued vacation.  (That matter is now in the hands of the courts.)  I&rsquo;m turning a corner now though, ready to return to the working world, ready for the structure of work.  Next week I will begin my job search.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The next generation TiVo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seems pretty uninspired to me.  I suspect that the game consoles are going to be what wins this whole digital media center battle.  I bought an Xbox a couple fo weeks ago, and it is only like three steps away from having the features that the TiVo has.  It has the necessary hardware now.  Having said that, I remain skeptical of the whole media center idea.  Unlike a better PDA, I do not find myself waiting with expectation for this stuff.</p>

			 <p>I honestly don&rsquo;t have much to say about the MacWorld keynote stuff.  I like the way the new iMac looks, but I have ceased to use desktop computers for the most part.  Laptops are more useful.  iPhoto, I downloaded and checked it out, it&rsquo;s really neat to have the easy output options for my digital photos.  I&rsquo;m much more interested in the progression of Mac OS X and digging into it.  I&rsquo;m on it full time now, and I have abandoned all of my classic apps for the time being.  The release of the Palm Desktop beta brings me to a point where I am only waiting on Photoshop/Fireworks/Flash.  Also, I still love my iPod.</p>

			 <p>Note to self:  do more research on the support and repair policies of companies you buy equipment from.  I bought a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nikon Coolpix 885<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a month ago.  Great camera, I was really enjoying it, especially the enhanced macro ability.  This afternoon, it just decided that it wasn&rsquo;t going to work anymore.  It&rsquo;s on strike or something.  Well, I have Christmas with my family next week and a wedding to go to after that, so I need my camera.  Nikon&rsquo;s support policies dictate that there is no way for me to have a working camera by that time.  Worse yet, they seem to have no sympathy to my plight whatsoever.  I don&rsquo;t care if they make the best camera on the planet that costs half what the other guys does, I&rsquo;ve made my last purchase with them.  A camera is no good to me if I can&rsquo;t use it when it really counts.</p>

			 <p>I obviously haven&rsquo;t been updating here much in the last couple of weeks.  Since I was laid off in October, I have been taking stock in things and trying to decide what I want to do next.  I was in New York visiting family last week, and my return to Atlanta was delayed by the sad plane crash on Monday.  I&rsquo;m now actively seeking new employment, but I&rsquo;m betting that I won&rsquo;t find something that I&rsquo;m excited about until after January 1st.  This is the worst time of year to look for new employment, with the holidays and the end of budget cycles interfering.  I&rsquo;m happy that I&rsquo;ve been smart with my money over the last couple of years because it has given me a lot more flexibility.  If, for some reason, I don&rsquo;t get to another update in the next couple of days, Happy Thanksgiving.  In the face of everything that has happened in the last couple of months, I feel, more than ever, that I have a real lot to be thankful for.  I have great people in my life, an amazing family, and my health.  These things are more important to me than anything as temporary as a job.</p>

These leagues have been expanding willy nilly over the last ten years especially.  I firmly believe that a storied franchise like the Twins, which was competitive even this season (they came in second place), shouldn&rsquo;t be considered for contraction.  Instead, they should be looking at the teams who were the most recently added, and they should look at long term viability rather than attendance from this year.  It would be a shame to get rid of the Minnesota franchise when both Florida franchises are a joke.</p>

			 <p>I have been using Mac OS X on my Mac laptop since August when it returned from its magical journey into the netherworld.(I really need to write up the whole saga of my hotel theft and how it ended up getting resolved.)  Today, for the first time in ages, I booted the machine into Mac OS 9 to use a USB device that has no OS X drivers.  Mac OS 9 now feels old fashioned to me.  It&rsquo;s slower, by far, on the same hardware.  Things crash, something that just doesn&rsquo;t happen to me on X.  Networking is not really as robust or as fast.  It&rsquo;s interesting how accustomed to a new technology you can become in two plus months.</p>

I think that it&rsquo;s interesting, or at least worth noting, that there has been a shift in this industry due to the dominance of some key players in each market segment.  Emerging companies, to some extent, can at best get the big players to take notice of what they are doing and get the big players to shift their strategy to encompass what the emerging company is doing.  We heard so much about Transmeta, partly because of Linus Torvalds' involvement, and how it was going to cause innovation in the portable space.  We saw Intel have to up their pace of innovation briefly in order to head this off.  So, in effect, they did cause innovation in the portable space.</p>

A friend hooked me up with backstage passes to both shows, and the first night, Ice Cube made an appearance with the opening band, whose name I can&rsquo;t remember right now, but they were proteges of his somehow.  While the Beasties were on stage that night, Hank was standing next to me watching the show.  The Beasties were really kicking it, and I turned to Hank to say something about how great they were.  Hank interrupted me saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, I watching the fucking show.&rdquo;  Then he walked away.</p>

Let me say now, however, that I have owned a Creative Nomad Jukebox, and the differences are huge.  The Nomad Jukebox eats batteries very quickly, and I got about two hours of playback at the most out of it.  The interface on it for navigating music is sometimes maddening, other times barely usable.  Finally, transferring music takes forever.  Sure it has huge capacity, but it has all sorts of things wrong with it.  I look forward to using something that tranfers the music more quickly, lasts longer, and has a better interface. (I had a RioVolt for a few weeks before it got stolen, and it had the same interface issue when there was a lot of music to navigate.)</p>

			 <p>Mmmm cable.  I haven&rsquo;t had television for over a month.  I mostly wanted to get it again now because of the baseball post-season.  I was so happy that the Yankees won their first series against Oakland.  Unlike many other Yankee fans these days it seems, I don&rsquo;t take the post-season for granted.  I was a Yankee fan through the very challenging eighties.  Say what you will, there is no franchise in the history of organized sports that has a larger commitment to excellence than the Bronx Bombers.  While other franchises may flirt with success, the Yanks have returned to the well over and over again.  Now, in my opinion, that&rsquo;s a philosphy.  That&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ve believed in for the twenty five years I have been a Yankee fan now, all my baseball life.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Conflict on the horizon.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  &ldquo;&hellip;they were holding the Saudi-born millionaire and hiding him in secret for his own safety.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m having a hard time understanding the tactical position that the Taliban, and even Bin Laden himself, are taking here.  It&rsquo;s clear, despite the difficulty of waging a conventional land war in Afghanistan, that the deck is so completely stacked against them that there is only one way in which they can even stay in power.  So, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to hand over this person, and maintain power in the country?  I&rsquo;m sure they could then talk the US into economic aid.  It seems that, regardless of their current position, they are choosing to try and win this one very small battle rather than looking long term.  Knowing this, there is only one explanantion that makes any sense, which is that Bin Laden is the one really running things there.  By not having an official position in the government he manipulates our current system of world nation state relations and poses a sort of Catch 22 situation.   From a PR perspective, it is necessary for our country to eliminate the confusion about his role in Afghanistan.</p>

If you liked Quicksand, you&rsquo;ll love this record.  It is quickly becoming my favorite CD released this year.  Like so many times in my life, I had a chance to see them a couple of weeks ago, but hadn&rsquo;t heard them yet, and so didn&rsquo;t know if I should go or not.  I went to a dinner party and out afterwards instead.  I am regretting not going to see them after the dinner party now.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oracle boss urges national ID cards, offers free software<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Every time I hear this idea, I see people whose political stances I normally agree with immediately and vehemently disagreeing.  Maybe I do not understand something about this issue, but it seems to me that we already have a somewhat national id system in our driver&rsquo;s licenses.  Because these vary on a state to state basis, they are much more difficult to track on a national level.  In many cases, including here in Georgia, fingerprint data is included in the existing ID.  So what&rsquo;s the big deal here?  I think this idea provides additional security, and would not necessarily cause any issues for law abiding citizens.  Please educate me as to why this is a bad idea.</p>

These kids will never be the same because of this, and there was nothing that they could do about it.  Losing a parent is the single most life altering event that a child could possibly experience.  It matters not whether they have adequate care from loving people, the kids will always be missing something.  How uncompassionate are the people who would do such a thing, rob children of their parents?  My anger does not fade, in fact it is enhanced with each day that goes by, with each heartbreaking story that I hear.  I will not forget.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Windows Me <!-- raw HTML omitted --> has to be the worst operating system ever released.  After weeks of rebooting my computer several times a day just trying to do basic work, I finally managed to damage some component of the start up/logon process.  Now, I cannot log onto the machine as myself.  During the same several week long time frame, I have also been using my Powerbook G4 every day.  It has crashed twice.  Of course, I can&rsquo;t get database work done right now, which is what needs to get done.  So I&rsquo;m angry that Microsoft&rsquo;s product, which I paid for like an idiot, is of substandard quality.  The answer, of course, is to spend more money upgrading to Windows XP, throwing good money after bad.  I wish we could demand that they improve the products we already have purchased so that they are usable before we buy a new version.  I&rsquo;m also angry that Microsoft&rsquo;s Database Client Tools only work on their operating system platform.  If it weren&rsquo;t for that one simple app, I would be using the Mac full time.  It&rsquo;s a spin cycle of lock in.</p>

First resolved to help in any way I can to heal the damage done to our country, to New York and to Washington, to the families and friends that lost people, and to our financial straits.  Second resolved to work towards a solution to the problem of terrorism on this planet.  We can clearly no longer treat our involvement with the rest of the nations and peoples on this planet as a trivial matter that will not have a direct effect on us each personally.  Nor should we turn the other cheek in this matter, but use a combination of all the means at our disposal including diplomacy, financial, technology, and, where necessary, devastating violence, to put an end to this threat to the planet.</p>

That you have no regard for the completely 100% innocent people whose lives were taken and the loved ones of those same people.

			 <p>The horror and immensity of it all.  I find myself struggling with comprehension, and somehow wishing that I could see the Pentagon or Manhattan first hand.  Of course, after talking to folks in Manhattan yesterday (everyone I know is ok), there are things to be seen there now that no one should ever have to see.  You can donate to the Red Cross Disaster fund <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I wish somehow that there was more I could do, something I could lift or carry, anything.  I know that I have to wait, like everyone else that isn&rsquo;t in these two cities, for our government to figure things out and then take care of these people. My thoughts are with those who have lost someone they were close to today, and will be forever.</p>

			 <p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been working on getting unpacked, and shopping for the immediate items of furniture that I think I should have.  There is a huge difference between a one bedroom apartment and a two bedroom house in terms of room.  Since I have only dialup access at home currently and was quite busy, I didn&rsquo;t sign on all weekend.  I&rsquo;ve become quite spoiled with high speed everywhere.  Since Earthlink and Bell South can&rsquo;t get to my Static IP DSL install for at least another week, I&rsquo;m going to have to either spend more time in the office to do my personal stuff or deal with the slow dialup.  On Friday night, I got the pool completely cleaned out and got the chemical balance where it was supposed to be.  This led to two days of swimming in the pool. I&rsquo;m really going to enjoy having it.</p>

			 <p>I slept in a house which I own by myself for the first time in my life last night.  I woke up this morning to birds chirping, and Loofa, my cat, attempting to get to the birds through the bedroom window.  I guess she hasn&rsquo;t had too much bird experience living in apartments.  It felt great to wake up in my house.  Of course, when I got out of bed and saw the hundred or so cardboard boxes full of my life, reality set in.  One thing I should say is that moving into a new house in the middle of the week, then returning to work, is not a good idea.  I can&rsquo;t concentrate at all.  Finally, I had pool school this morning.  I learned about Ph and Chlorine, and filters and cleaning.  A pool is a lot of work, but of course I knew that.  I&rsquo;m just hoping to get three of four weeks of swimming in before I have to close it.  Well, back to work.</p>

			 <p>I see a lot of links to the HP/Compaq merger.  I wonder what Microsoft thinks of the two makers, who control something like 68% of the consumer PC market, becoming one company.  Suddenly, Microsoft is almost beholden to a single vendor in that one space.  For the record, I think that this is a bad merger, and unless it is executed in a very very careful manner, it could prove to be the death of both companies.</p>

Anyone got any experience with it?  I&rsquo;m looking for something that I can&rsquo;t seem to find so far, a legitimate computer in a handheld form factor.  My long gone Compaq iPaq was most of the way there, but had some interface clumsiness that I really disliked.  I think it still had vestiges of the whole Windows Everywhere strategy in it.  My Sony Clie 710, the current contender, is decent but is limited to 128 Mb of memory and has no other expansion capabilities.  Palm has really dropped the ball in innovating the OS, but you already knew that I thought that.  So, I&rsquo;m interested in the VR3.</p>

A comeback now is bound to diminish his legacy, especially returning to a mediocre team like the Washington Wizards.  There is no possible way that the Wizards will be able to compete with the likes of the Shaq and Kobe Lakers.  The supporting cast, and coach, that he had in Chicago made his incredible run possible.  He should stay retired as the most dominant player in the nineties and a Chicago Bull.</p>

Not from the perspective that Outlook isn&rsquo;t software worth cloning, I use it every day and I think it&rsquo;s fine.  Also, not from the perspective that cloning is unusual, cloning is a fact of life in the software business.  I&rsquo;m surprised that Open Source programmers at Ximian don&rsquo;t have some radical new way of doing this sort of app.  I want innovation, not status quo.  I should say that I have not used this app and I am basing my opinion on the screen shots.  There could be plumbing there that I am unaware of.  This, I assure you, will not be the value add that gets people to migrate from Windows to Linux.  In fact, it sort of plays into MSFT&rsquo;s hands.</p>

I instead, believe that the elbow is the waist of the arm. Sure we wear watches on our wrists like we do belts on our waist, but the wrist is nowhere near the middle of the arm.  This would cause a massive balance problem, and therefore the wrist cannot be the waist of the arm. Could you imagine if our waist was at chest level?  How ridiculous.  Care to support the cause?  Email me your reasons why the wrist is not the waist of the arm. (contact link above.)</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Palm seeks software boost with Be buy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Palm was not one of the suitors I expected for Be at all.  On the other hand, this might give Palm the foothold in the appliance market they need to counter Windows CE&rsquo;s range from set tops to handhelds.  I&rsquo;ve been reading Breaking Windows, and one thing that it impressed upon me is the success of the Windows Everywhere strategy.  It&rsquo;s tough to fight against an opponent that helps it&rsquo;s developers leverage a wider range of devices.  When reading this section of the book, the first thing that popped into my mind was Palm&rsquo;s eroding market share.  In this case, however, it&rsquo;s not a question of Microsoft leveraging the desktop monopoly.  They have actually out innovated Palm and it&rsquo;s partners in the last year.  Palm&rsquo;s lack of innovation is something I was commenting on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last month<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Things ended up working out quite smoothly today.  I closed in about an hour and a half, and then went over to the house and changed the locks myself, which is quite a bit easier than I thought it would be.  In the process, I mastered the art of locking myself out of my new house and was forced to break into it.  The closing itself was sort of anticlimatic after all of the hard work it took to get there.  Just a lot of paper signing and some joking around, nothing more.  What&rsquo;s up next?  Lots of work, and then moving.</p>

It&rsquo;s full of witty observational humor, some of which I&rsquo;m sure was lost on me as it is set in Britain, and I don&rsquo;t pretend to be familiar with the nuances of British life.  It also asks some tough questions through the wit, and I will be thinking about those for the next few days.  I&rsquo;d say, without reservation, that it&rsquo;s worth picking up and reading.</p>

It&rsquo;s clear that no one has figured this advertising on the Internet thing properly. It&rsquo;s also clear to me that pop under ads are not the answer, nor are banner ads, or rich media advertising and I can&rsquo;t see clearly what the solution is.</p>

It started out as an HP desktop about two years ago, but it doesn&rsquo;t resemble the machine it once was.  In fact, the HP restore disks no longer recognize it as an HP, which has led to ocassional issues in installing software.  Prior to installing XP on the system, I had 2000 Professional on the machine.  Everything worked, and worked smoothly.  So my expectations were that everything device wise would continue to work after the upgrade.  Boy was I mistaken.</p>

			 <p>Today&rsquo;s laptop update:  I received a battered COD package this morning, and after paying the substantial fee, I unpacked a battered and beaten G4 Powerbook that is clearly mine.  My data has returned, and I am now much more scared that someone else had access to all of it than I was previously.  One twist I hadn&rsquo;t expected was that someone who knew Mac OS X well used the laptop while it was gone.  Many settings were changed, things were moved around, and most of my customizations to the system were removed.  This incident renews my faith in humans somewhat.</p>

			 <p>Things here seem to be getting crazier by the day.  I finally got to the contract stage with the house I was offering on for the last two weeks, so that is getting hectic quick.  Inspection tomorrow, and then things start to get even more stressful.  At the same time, my stolen laptop reared it&rsquo;s head this afternoon in the form of someone who bought the Powerbook G4 at a tag sale for $500, then got suspicious later.  I got a call out of the blue asking me about it, and I may be receiving it in the mail on Wednesday.  Or maybe not.  In related news, California law states that a hotel may only be responsible for a maximum of $250 for each bag stolen from a room.  That&rsquo;s a great law for us business travelers huh?</p>

			 <p>Man am I ticked off at Sony right now.  I bought a Sony laptop a couple of weeks ago to have a machine to use until I can replace my Powerbook.  I made sure to buy a model that ships with either ME or 2000 for compatibility purposes.  Since the store did not have the Windows 2000 version in stock, I went ahead and bought the ME version, knowing that I had an extra Windows 2000 license at home that I could use to upgrade the machine.  Since there is a version that ships with Windows 2000 drivers, I figured that I could either download the drivers I would need or have Sony send me the drivers CD for the machine.  Turns out that neither are available right now, and they can&rsquo;t give me a date when they will be.  I&rsquo;m stuck with crappy unstable Windows ME, and very unhappy with Sony.  I wouldn&rsquo;t buy this machine if I had it to do again, and I may just go ahead and return it.  God I sound like a Whiner.</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t really seem like it has been revamped in a long while.  Also, they still rely on third parties for even their integration with Outlook.  Sure they bundle the software in the box, but this is an essential part of what their software does.  Just from my own outside opinions, it seems like Palm is missing the boat on a lot of things.  Each of their licensees has innovated in some way, but it would be nice if they could tie all of those innovations together moving forward.</p>

			 <p>I am finally recovering from the massive data loss and sheer privacy invasion of my laptop disappearance.  It has taken me a while.  I bought new equipment, not the same stuff I had because I frankly couldn&rsquo;t afford it.  I&rsquo;m hoping the hotel&rsquo;s insurance will cover the rest.  I&rsquo;ve written up the whole story, but don&rsquo;t want to publish it yet in case the thief is smart enough to check this site.  I must have changed 200 passwords in the last few days, and spent almost a week getting software installed and configured.  Now I have to get back on track at work where this has cost me at least one work week.  Back up your data every day boys and girls, and encrypt stuff you don&rsquo;t want others to see with PGP and password utilities like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Web Confidential<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Mac OS, Windows, and Palm).</p>

			 <p>I apologize for the lack of updates.  When staying in San Francisco over the weekend, someone broke into my hotel room and stole my Titanium Laptop, iPaq, and all of the other various pieces of computer equipment that I had brought on the trip for work.  The most disturbing thing in the whole mess is the loss of my data and the invasion of my privacy.  If you know someone in the bay area that may have purchased items like this at hot prices, feel free to email me.  I, of course, have the police on the case.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac OS X vs. Windows 2000 Deathmatch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I&rsquo;d say this is a pretty fair comparison of the two operating systems based on the criteria that was chosen.  Since I have one running each of these operating systems in my bag, I&rsquo;d have to say that I would place a little more weight on the availability of software for the OS than they have in this article.  While Mac OS X is fantastic, some of that is potential currently and nothing more.  On the other hand, Windows 2000 is like a pair of shoes that have been broken in over the last two years, all the software I need runs on it.  Once X gets up a full head of steam, it will be a better operating system than 2000 or even XP, but we&rsquo;re at least 6 months away from that, and possibly as many as 12.  Who knows what Microsoft will do with that time?</p>

			 <p>New York Times: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Microsoft Is Set to Be Top Foe of Free Code<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  How shocking that Microsoft is now attempting the same tactics they have against commercial opponents against Open Source software.    The GPL is not all of Open Source, and Microsoft is the enemy of innovation, not Open Source software.  The real problem here is that the Open Source community doesn&rsquo;t have a PR department and Microsoft does.  The amazing thing here is that Microsoft has been driven to improve their software by the existence of Open Source competition and they have actually used Open Source software as a part of some of their products.</p>

No documentation whatsoever about the update beyond one paragraph on the Apple Mac OS X page.  Since you apply it through their software update system panel, you don&rsquo;t download the update as a separate file.  I find it sort of disturbing to not know what got changed, what got improved, and what was new.

I&rsquo;d take what he says there a step further and express the concern that the unreasonable web people may have ruined several viable business opportunities for everyone who follows them.  It&rsquo;s going to be hard to get funding for ideas like another Kozmo with all of these failures and the bad press that has followed them.  Having said that, my experience has been that VC firms  as a group aren&rsquo;t particularly brilliant at distinguishing between a real business opportunity that meets a market need and is staffed with talented people and folks who haven&rsquo;t got a clue with some lame business plan with no focus.</p>

Instead, I spent a lot of time reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cryptonomicon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is a suberb book, and an equal amount of time in the park on my skates.  The weather in Atlanta has been Springish, and I have been happy.</p>

			 <p>Okay, I&rsquo;m back, and doing better than I should be.  I loved my grandfather very much, he had a much bigger hand in who I turned out to be than even people who have known me for a long time might suspect.  When I was really small, and my brother and I lived with he and my grandmother, I can remember getting out of bed at 5:30 am and sneaking to where I could watch him leave for work with his thermos and lunchbox.  He was a great person, and though I think I&rsquo;ve turned out to be a very different sort of person myself, I aspire to be the type of quality man that he was.  If you&rsquo;ve met me, you have met him, or at least a little part of him that lives on through me.  Wherever you are now Gramps, just know that I am minding my own business.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been telling people that I&rsquo;m platform agnostic for a while now.  That I don&rsquo;t care what computer platform I use, and I prefer one over the other just based on particular tasks.  For the last two months, I&rsquo;ve been using my Macs less and less.   First it was all about databases.  Then I bought the iPaq, and I had good reason to want all my scheduling, email, and contacts on one Windows machine.  My investment in software is now buggin me, I don&rsquo;t want to buy things twice, and I want everything I need on one machine.  I&rsquo;m <em>gasp</em> becoming a full time Windows 2000 user.  Someone get Mac OS X over here stat.</p>

This terrible customer service is the most compelling reason for me to go with some sort of dish solution.  They weren&rsquo;t apologetic at all, and wouldn&rsquo;t work with me about the reschedule at all.  More evidence about the disturbing decline in customer service in today&rsquo;s corporate world.</p>

			 <p>My last Monday in the office this year.  A good time for me to mull over the last year of my career and look ahead a little.  Tomorrow, I head off on my last business trip of the year, traveling out to our headquarters in California for a couple of days of year end meetings.  There&rsquo;s something that is very anti-holiday about business travel this close to Christmas.  It&rsquo;s been an interesting year, more from a business experience perspective than a technical one.  We sold our company, integrated/are still integrating with the buyers, and are moving ahead with the new company&rsquo;s strategies.  This is not a experience without some level of discomfort.  Most of the technical experience that I&rsquo;ve gotten has to do with project design and architecture, and I spent a lot of time learning XML oriented technology.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to 2001 from a career perspective, despite the current climate for Internet companies.  The industry is being punished for people with questionable business ideas who overhyped the value of those businesses, with the help of the venture capital and investment communities.  The inevitable chain reaction through the companies that feed off the failed dot-coms has lead to the demise and devaluation of the service companies that make up the next rung of the food chain.  The only thing I have to say/can say to everyone is to not throw the baby out with the bath water, to not follow the hype back in the other direction.  There&rsquo;s a middle ground there inhabited by companies with good ideas and value propositions for their customers.  There are whole realms where the networked world is going to impact things in our lives in far reaching ways that we haven&rsquo;t seen yet.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Well here we are the day after, and it looks like we won&rsquo;t know until tomorrow who won Florida and got the electoral votes necessary to win the election.  If Bush wins, despite the fact that more Americans voted for Gore, it will be a depressing failure of our system in my opinion.  Regardless of your party affiliation or particular viewpoint on this election, I&rsquo;m of the opinion that, in a representative democracy, the candidate that the majority of the people voted for should win.  If this doesn&rsquo;t happen, the person who won did so through a loophole in our system.  This is a horrible situation for our country.</p>

			 <p>Customer service is dead.  Three weeks ago, I purchased a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Compaq iPaq Pocket PC<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Looks great, interesting feature set, and some stellar  reviews on the Web.  I had it for two days, and I was really  enjoying it.  Then, things took a turn for the worse.   The screen started showing everything backwards.  I would have returned it in exchange for a new unit, but CompUSA wasn&rsquo;t  getting any more for at least a month.  So I called Compaq, and they seemed great.  They sent me a box and I sent it off to be repaired with the promise of the unit being returned in 3-5 days.  I waited 5 days, then I called them again.  My unit needed a new main board.  As it turns out, there are problems with the main boards in a lot of the units, there is a main board problem.  The boards are backordered and I&rsquo;m in line waiting behind other suckers that bought the defective unit.</p>

			 <p>I keep reading on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave Winer&rsquo;s site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about how great the Mets are, how they have some super philosophy that makes them different, and better, than the average sports franchise.  Clearly, this thing is a construct in his mind.  I haven&rsquo;t heard any of the announcers for FOX talking about it, nor has it been mentioned on the half dozen episodes of Sportscenter I&rsquo;ve watched on ESPN this week.  I&rsquo;m not a Mets expert, however, despite having lived in New York State for seven years, so I leave that to those much more qualified to address it.  Something I do know about are the Yankees.  He claims <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;they have no soul&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I disagree, no other professional sports team, with the possible exception of the storied Boston Celtics and Canada&rsquo;s Montreal Canadians, has more soul and tradition than the Yankees.  I&rsquo;m the third generation in a long line of Yankee fans.  The Yankees franchise has a deeper place in American culture than any other sports franchise.   Period.  Have you heard of Babe Ruth?  Joe Dimaggio? Mickey Mantle?  I thought so.  Have you heard of Dave Kingman?</p>

I don&rsquo;t know if they asked for permission from Foodvision to picture it, but it&rsquo;s for that reason that I don&rsquo;t really like services like the ones discussed in this article.  They take a small snippet from a Web site and picture it out of the context that the site intended that content to be show.  It&rsquo;s sort of involuntary reverse syndication. I guess the argument would be that this gets your site a visitor and exposure, but I would argue that without the context of the site it really doesn&rsquo;t benefit the content provider in a commercial environment very much.</p>

Adversity is an opportunity to change things in yourself that you don&rsquo;t like, to learn something new about you.  Sure I&rsquo;ve got a few new gray hairs that I didn&rsquo;t have before, but I also am lighter, leaner, and have much better perspective about where I am and where I want to go.</p>

While I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll end up writing a much longer piece with overall impressions and some detailed information for you techies, my first impressions were powerful ones.  I installed it on my G3 Powerbook and on a Blue and White G3 tower yesterday.  Installation is easy as pie.  The Aqua interface didn&rsquo;t annoy me as much as I thought.  I had a little bit of a hard time getting the Classic(read legacy) Mac OS environment to work properly, but it was the fault of extensions that communicate directly with hardware.  It&rsquo;s seems very powerful, and it works.  By the time this thing gets to market, it&rsquo;s going to be a juggernaut.</p>

It&rsquo;s different from most Fantasy books in that there is a rich and deep sub-text about the main character&rsquo;s battle with leprosy that is inextricably linked to his behavior in the book.  If you like Fantasy and haven&rsquo;t read this series, you should get on it. I love re-reading books at different times in my life.  It leads to picking out different things, and learning different things from the same book.  How my imagination drew the characters ten years ago and how it draws them now are different.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m still in Boston, and will be returning to Atlanta tomorrow.  The XML World show was pretty good, despite my getting sick on the second day and being kind of laid up for 24 hours as a result.  There is so much happening with XML so rapidly right now that I don&rsquo;t think anyone can easily have a handle on everything.  I was a little dissapointed to find that some of the major players weren&rsquo;t at this show, but IBM and some of the other big players that were here didn&rsquo;t dissapoint.  The one SOAP session today was canceled at the last moment, which was a huge dissapointment.  Tonight, I&rsquo;m going to make my second trip to Fenway Park this week to try and see the Yankees, with the Rocket on the mound, play the Red Sox.</p>

The best general resource I&rsquo;ve found so far is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XSLT.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.   Their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;What is XSLT?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page is an excellent overview of what it is and what it is used for.

			 <p>I&rsquo;m a huge music consumer.  I mean really huge.  I buy at least two cd&rsquo;s a week, sometimes more.  I have a huge CD and record collection, and music has always played an important role in my life.  I look around my apartment and realize that I am the record label&rsquo;s idea of a best customer.  I use Napster every single day at work.  Rarely is it to check out music that I have never heard of, and almost never is it to download music I don&rsquo;t already own.  Ocassionally I&rsquo;ll use it to check out some songs by a group somone has recommended to me directly or via a Web site, but if I like it, I always buy the cd.  Part of the reason for my use of Napster is convenience.  I don&rsquo;t have a 100 Gb hard drive to carry all of my CD&rsquo;s around with me, and I can rarely predict what I&rsquo;m going to be in the mood to listen to.  The other part is laziness.  I don&rsquo;t have the free time to rip my thousands of CD&rsquo;s to MP3 to make my collection portable.  In the end, it&rsquo;s good news they got the stay, but I think that the labels are being incredibly short sighted and I think everyone knows it but them.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->MacWEEK: Inside the Cube<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  confirms many things that I have thought since the Cube&rsquo;s introduction by Steve Jobs on Wednesday.  First, it&rsquo;s not technically a cube at all.  Second, it&rsquo;s really not any kind of innovation.  It&rsquo;s the innards of a notebook computer with a full size hard drive jammed into a small form factor.  It is not technologically unique in any real way from the other desktop computers that Apple sells.  Steve, however, knows that he will sell a lot of these cubes and that is what this is all about.  I would rather see Cupertino coming out with something innovative, take a couple of chances, and do something that makes me say wow.</p>

			 <p>Wow, I have quite the different opinion of the X-Men movie than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim has<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I also was a longtime reader of the comic book, and I actually even worked in a comic book shop for a year or so.  I thought that the movie was entertaining, but was somewhat dissapointed with how little some of the characters, notably Jean Grey and Scott Summers(Cyclops) were developed and used.  Overall, I thought it was a good movie if you are familiar and already love the characters, but I didn&rsquo;t think it was a good standalone movie.  There is a this rich history of stories from the comic that I wish they had tapped into a little more.  Sabretooth is Wolverine&rsquo;s father and they didn&rsquo;t even hint that Sabretooth knew who Wolverine even was.</p>

			 <p>Well, I&rsquo;ve got some big news today.  We sold our company to a larger pre-IPO Silicon Valley firm with what,  I think, is a great future and an interesting strategy based on XML technology.  The last couple of months has been pretty crazy as we(the arthouse management team) fielded offers from a couple of companies, made a difficult decision about which one, if any, we wanted to pursue, and then worked our way through the merger process.  It&rsquo;s been a great, but a little stressful, experience.  I&rsquo;m a little wealthier on paper today, but that&rsquo;s never been the most important thing to me in the first place.  I&rsquo;ll link to the new company as soon as the press releases go out, I don&rsquo;t want to steal any thunder from the PR machine.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m getting a lot done today on my apartment, which is slowly making the transition from the place where I sleep into a home.  I really wish I could spend some time fixing all the problems with the current iteration of Bump and add some of the new content I was planning on adding when I redesigned a few months ago, but I much more focused on the real world right now.  I&rsquo;m still 40 lbs. lighter than I was in March, and I look much much better.(I know this because other people are noticing this fact on a regular basis.  It&rsquo;s flattering when someone you barely know stops you outside your building at work to tell you how great you look, but it&rsquo;s even more flattering when an attractive woman you don&rsquo;t know approaches you with obvious interest.  This wasn&rsquo;t happening a few months ago, and now it&rsquo;s happening on a regular basis.)  I&rsquo;m still an emotional wreck from what&rsquo;s happened in my life over the last few months, but at least I recognize that fact and am doing something about it.  I appreciate my life so much more now than I ever have before, my family, my friends, my job, and myself.</p>

I saw The Patriot, which I thought was mediocre, and The Perfect Storm, which I thought was mediocre.  Both were a little too Hollywood for my tastes, and I thought the first was very much a slightly altered version of Braveheart set in the American colonies during the war for independence.  I hope your weekend is going as well as mine.  Now I&rsquo;m off to configrue my home entertainment center(this is a monster job with 9 components).</p>

			 <p>I want to elaborate on the comments below about the Bungie acquisition.  This is not a good thing for consumers.  I just read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the FAQ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that Bungie has posted on their site, and it is quite clear that this means that, in order to get access to future Bungie titles, possibly including the much anticipated HALO, you will have to buy an XBox from Microsoft.  It&rsquo;s all about lock in and other ugly things, and I&rsquo;m sure that the owners of Bungie got the compensation that they deserved in the deal.(They have done some amazing work over the last seven years.)  Microsoft is buying them to create a barrier of entry for their new console, and for no other reason.</p>

I&rsquo;m also trying really hard to sort out some confusing life stuff that can&rsquo;t be blogged for a variety of reasons.  It&rsquo;s been a really rough few months for me, with exciting work stuff tempered by some very difficult personal issues.

It was also pretty clear that they don&rsquo;t have any way of accounting for Kobe&rsquo;s slashing to the basket.

			 <p>I&rsquo;m spending fewer and fewer hours in front of the computer right now, and I think it&rsquo;s really doing me some good.  In addition to losing 35 lbs.(I made it to my first goal of 195 lbs. last week), I&rsquo;m reading more books and spending more time working on myself.  This week, however, seems like it will be a little different due to my workload.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m so tired of traveling.  Thankfully, I won&rsquo;t be doing any more in the near future.  Over the Memorial day weekend, I continued my string of 5 straight weeks with a plane trip somewhere for three days or less.  I participated as a groomsman in one of my best friends in the world&rsquo;s wedding.  It was a great time, and so very nice to see two people who are meant to be together make it official.  Deb and JC, I wish both of you the best in your new voyage together.</p>

			 <p>I went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Crate &amp; Barrel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday to look at beds, and brought my digital camera so I could easily remember what beds I saw in which store.  I found one I thought would be a good candidate for my apartment so I took out the camera and shot a couple of pictures of it.  Almost immediately, a snotty salesperson descended on me and informed me that they didn&rsquo;t allow any pictures.  When I explained why I needed to take them, he said that I had to have him take Polaroids of the items I was interested in and that I should wait for him to come back and help me.  He then went back to helping another customer for almost a half an hour before I finally got angry enough to leave.  Guess I won&rsquo;t be buying my bed, or any of my furniture, at Crate &amp; Barrel.</p>

It really bums me out that some of my favorite sites don&rsquo;t work properly through the rendering engine in these new browsers.  Not only that, but they break things in completely different ways.  The end result is that people who build Front End interfaces for sites have to do that much more work to create the same experience for everyone coming to the site.  Mozilla shows, by far in my opinion, the most promise of any of the currently available browsers.  Question though, where is the windows menu, or any menu driven way to change which window is active?</p>

I returned home from SXSW full of inspiration, and I had no idea how much I had let my life and myself get off of the track I meant for it to be on.  I had somehow lost track of who I wanted to be.  The wakeup call that it took to get me to realize this was the most bitter pill I have ever swallowed.  My girlfriend of almost six years left me.  I&rsquo;m heartbroken, because I&rsquo;m still very much in love with her.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave<!-- raw HTML omitted --> asks for a comparison between Manila and Blogger. Not a subject to be taken lightly for me. To start, here are some screenshots of the editing environments(kinda big): <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Manila Bump<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogger Editorial Interface<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Existing Desktop Editing Enviroment<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>First, where I think they are the same. Both provide a Web based editorial environment from which to update your site. Both allow you to do this within an HTML framework of your own choosing. Blogger allows you to edit and upload regardless of where you are and where your site is hosted. Manila, today, is strictly limited to editing pages that are on a Manila server, but you can do that from any Web connection just like Blogger. I&rsquo;m sure that Userland plans to add the ability to use Manila to update sites served on non-Manila servers from static HTML, or even possibly other types of dynamically served environments. Both editing environments are compelling, but Manila&rsquo;s supports as many pages as you create, where Blogger is focused primarily on pages that contain Weblog entries. This ends up meaning that Manila has much wider reaching applications and can be used for every page of a site rather than just the actual Welog page. The entry interface on blogger is seperate from the actual page of content you are posting(see screen shot above.), and I think that it makes it a more friendly interface for the daily entries that it is focused on. Both environments support multiple author sites.(Which I won&rsquo;t be using, but others might want to know about.)</p>
<p>The editorial environment on Blogger 2.0 is also more mature.(Thus the 2.0 in its name.) It features a search engine that allows you to pull up your entires with certain strings in them. When I have two hundred daily entries in this new site, it would be really useful to have this feature. Manila provides the same functionality, assuming that you have the search engine turned on and indexing your site. Blogger also allows you to preview and then edit your posting before actually publishing it to the site. I would like to see more customization of the editorial environment in both apps. I would like to have one place as a site editor with all of my links to frequently visited sites and the edit interface for the site. This is possible with Manila through some template customization, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten to that stage yet.</p>
<p>My recommendation right now is determined by your situation. If you have an existing Weblog type site and already have a hosting environment and space, you&rsquo;re better off using Blogger. It will take far less reworking to get things up and running, and you won&rsquo;t have to sacrifice any other server side stuff you currently use such as PERL, Cold Fusion etc.. If you don&rsquo;t have these things, the space on Userland&rsquo;s Manila server offers you a chance to set things up from scratch and benefit from Userland&rsquo;s ongoing improvement of their offering. If you have your own server box, you can buy Frontier and set up your own Manila framework for your self and others.(I have a retired desktop machine serving 9 sites) It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that Userland has been improving their software on an almost daily basis. I have my copy of Frontier automatically update itself over the Internet every night, and those new features will appear in the interface seemingly out of nowhere. I love that.</p>
<p>Now, my dilemma. I like both environment&rsquo;s, but I have more content on my site than just the Weblog entries, and I have some plans to add to that content so I like the fact that Manila offers me the full site editing functionality. I&rsquo;m not currently using anything server side with my site, so that&rsquo;s not an issue. Bump has been hosted by Mindspring since before I even had the domain name, and the hosting includes mail and dns. In order for me to move Bump to Manila, I&rsquo;ll either have to bite the bullet and build that stuff for my Manila server or continue to pay Mindspring for the space without actually using it. Another issue that I haven&rsquo;t touched on are my legacy Weblog entries. There is no easy way to move the two years of entries that I already have into either system&rsquo;s framework. I could do this with Manila by doing it by hand in the Guest Database framework that Manila is built from, but the amount of labor that would take seems pretty monumental. So I remain undecided, but leaning towards using Manila.</p>
