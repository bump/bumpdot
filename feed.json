				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Week 30 felt like it went by way too fast. My kids' last week of Summer, as they go back to school tomorrow. All four of us went to the <a href=\"https://www.atlutd.com/\">Atlanta United</a> Leagues' Cup game Friday night, which they lost on Penalty Kicks. While it was a good time because all four of us were there, it's been a rough season to be an Atlanta United fan. After seven years, since their first season, of having season tickets, I think I might be canceling for next season, because they raised the price again. We haven't been having as much fun at the games as we used to. I'm still waffling though. <br><br>This week's media consumption has been <a href=\"https://olympics.com\">Olympics, Olympics, Olympics</a>. I really enjoyed watching the Opening Ceremony live, and am really glad I have nothing to do with LA 2028 because that thing would be a hard act to follow.  There are currently three TV's in our house streaming different sports. I am, of course, watching the surfing from Tahiti, which is once of the coolest venues on our tour. My older son has been fencing for years, and this is one of the very few opportunities to watch that sport at its highest level. The whole family has been watching those events. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Watching the <a href=\"https://www.usab.com\">USA basketball teams</a> is, for me, just so much fun.  I'm excited for another week of this. The huge smile on Kevin Durant's face during their game against Serbia brought a smile to mine, too. <br><br>I really enjoyed this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mrb2Ot0u7co\">Atlanta Michelin Eats Video</a> from a YouTuber who I wasn't previously familiar with, Mike Chen. A few of my favorite spots were featured in this video, like <a href=\"https://www.fredsmeatandbread.com\">Fred's Meat &amp; Bread</a>, <a href=\"https://www.arepamiaatlanta.com\">Arepa Mia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.foodterminal.com\">Food Terminal</a>. It still had some that I haven't tried, and those have been added to me to do list.  There's something fun about watching travel and food videos about the town you live in. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I finished four books this week. <br><br>After really enjoying my read of Moonbound last week, I managed to find <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33916024-sourdough\">Sourdough</a> by Robin Sloan on <a href=\"https://libbyapp.com/\">Libby</a> and it was available! This one was a quick read, delightful as well, and I will read his other book as soon as the queue comes up. This book made me want colder weather so I could enjoy a nice bowl of soup and a piece of sourdough. <br><br>I continue to plow through all of Erik Larson's books, this week it was <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195608683-the-demon-of-unrest\">The Demon of Unrest</a>. This one is mostly about the start of the Civil War and Fort Sumnter. It provides a real lot of details about the transition from the Buchanan administration to the Lincoln administration and the origins of secession. It's not one I would recommend unless you are really interested in that amount of information on that topic, but I really got a lot out of it. <br><br><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101673225-land-of-milk-and-honey\">Land of Milk and Honey</a> by C Pam Zhang had been on my Libby queue for a really long time, I think since last Summer. This book about a chef working for a billionaire in a timeline where planet's food supply has been disrupted is well crafted and worth your time, especially if you're really into food. It actually paired well in a weird way with Sourdough above, without any intention to pair them on my part.  <br><br><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/661723.Bushido\">Bushido: The Soul of Japan</a> by Niobe Inaz≈ç reads like a guide to the chivalric traditions of Japan. I mainly read this looking for parallels to Stoic thought, and they were there. It is a very old book, and felt old. <br><br>I've been meaning for a few weeks to find one of these entries to talk about the pair of <a href=\"https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/discover-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses/clp?cid=CM-EPD_RB_Supernova_ProductUnderstanding-ecomm_25701325&amp;bxid=242944288705&amp;h5e=\">Ray-Ban | Meta Glasses</a> that I bought and have been using. First, I don't particularly trust Facebook/Meta, and I have turned off anything even remotely creepy with these. No location services especially. I mainly use them when I go for walks, which have been much more frequent since my surgery in May. For this purpose, these things are an amazing combination of sunglasses/headphones/camera. The pictures they take are actually pretty good, the headphones are serviceable. I'm getting a fair amount of use from them. Again, not wearing these anywhere where taking pictures would be creepy.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Some pretty intensive meetings, and lots of interesting conversation. Overall, it went well, but I learned that I do have some physical limitations, and sitting in a hard chair for 6-8 hours a day in a meeting ended up causing some soreness.¬†The flights, at least, went by without any issues. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I landed back in Atlanta, via a red-eye, to drive with my family from Atlanta to a beach house we rented for the week down in <a href=\"https://30a.com\">30A in Florida</a>.¬† I then had a week that was mostly off, going to the beach with my family each day. Reading on the beach while listening to music is one of my happiest places. ¬†The beaches down there are some of the nicest in the US. We also always make time to head to <a href=\"https://seasidefl.com\">Seaside</a> for a day of walking around in the shops, and browsing the stacks at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sundogbooks/\">Sun Dog</a> one of my absolute favorite book stores.  We also send some postcards from the cute post office there. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I finished <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195790867-moonbound\">Moonbound</a> by Robin Sloan. I‚Äôve always been a sucker for Aurthurian fiction and this inventive and interesting science fiction take on that classic tale was no exception. I hadn't previously read anything by Robin Sloan. I am going to read his other two books, I added them to my Libby queue as soon as I finished this one. ¬†Recommended. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also finished <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60387307-novelist-as-a-vocation\">Novelist as a Vocation</a> by Haruki Murakami, who is one of my favorite authors. This one reads like a career autobiography, with many interesting notes on his perception of his progression as an author. I found a lot to be inspired by while reading this one on the beach and away from work. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also finished <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33080122-the-calculating-stars\">The Calculating Stars </a>by Mary Robinette Kowal. This \"Lady Astronaut\" novel is an alternate history of the US where a major disaster has altered the course of history and space exploration. Lots of social commentary, as the book happens in the 50's and 60's, and I really enjoyed it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I read using my <a href=\"https://shop.boox.com/products/palma\">Boox Palma</a> the entire week I was on the road for work and at the beach. It's a great device for both travel and at the beach. My daily carry beach bag for the Palma, my iPhone 15 Pro Max, wallet etc. is the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C1kLnfHRpTu/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">Channel Sacoche in Black</a> from <a href=\"https://makr.com\">Makr</a>. It is the perfect size for everything without being too big. They don't have any made right now, but said they would be making more soon. They aren't cheap, but are really high quality. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One very recommended gadget that we use at the beach is our Ultimate Ears - <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/speakers/bluetooth-speakers/wonderboom-4.984-001876.html\">WONDERBOOM 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker</a> (I'm linking to the 4 because they don't have a page on their site with the 2 any longer.) I bought this speaker on clearance from Best Buy in 2020, and we use it all the time, it has held up really well and sounds great. I have it attached to a <a href=\"https://www.gearaid.com/pages/heroclip\">HeroClip</a> to make it easy to hang from the umbrella or chairs. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3971,\"width\":\"451px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"media\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.bump.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4229-scaled.jpg\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/24d7db417e.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3971\" style=\"width:451px;height:auto\"></a></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

For those in the States, hope you have a great 4th of July weekend. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've had a pretty great, but stressful, couple of weeks. I continue to be able to do more and more post-surgery, and went to the gym a couple of times this week. I'm mostly still just walking, but am starting to work on my mobility and doing some band and body weight strength stuff. Some really sore days.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Last Saturday, we went to an<a href=\"https://www.atlutd.com\"> Atlanta United</a> game (We have season tickets.) for the first time since before my spinal surgery.

I found this science fiction book to be quite a mind expander, very inventive, has a certain modern-Lovecraft vibe to it too. Highly recommend. You can find more information on <a href=\"https://qntm.org/scp\">qntm's site</a>. I'm going to be reading everything else by him. <br><br>I also finished \"<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22551730-dead-wake\">Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania</a>\" by Erik Larsen, the second book of his I've read in a few weeks. This one was great, a lot about the time period, German U-boats, the beginning of WWI and the US's entrance into the conflict. I really didn't know much about the Lusitania going in, so I soaked up a lot of new information. This won't be the last Erik Larsen book I will be reading this year. <br><br>I watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkYvENC37eM\">this Salt Hank video</a> about making Anthony Bourdain's favorite sandwich, which led me to make this sandwich, and now it's one of my favorites, too. I've made it a couple of times, and I have to say that it will be a permanent part of my lunch rotation moving forward. I wish I had known to go and try it where he discovered it in S√£o Paulo. I was there two years ago. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We finished watching <a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/series/the-bear-05eb6a8e-90ed-4947-8c0b-e6536cbddd5f?utm_source=tkt_press&amp;utm_medium=tkt_organic&amp;utm_campaign=tkt_the-bear\">The Bear: Season Three</a>. I wish there was more that I hadn't watched yet, but that's all there is for now. I couldn't be more enthusiastic about this show. The music selection and how the music is folded into the episodes is just so good. <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Vufk20tti6db2FxMlMOOh?si=9dgWy90lTj2M8WDdqSKJ7g&amp;pi=u-dNvqBS26QFy9&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=f97e51a2ef964b8f\">Here's an unofficial Spotify Playlist</a>. Finally, watching episode six, the \"Napkins\" episode, I was struck by how it is, in part, an homage to <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/\">Groundhog Day</a>, one of my all time favorite movies. (If you're familiar with Groundhog Day, and you watch this episode, you'll get it.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:group {\"layout\":{\"type\":\"flex\",\"flexWrap\":\"nowrap\"}} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's funny, I have been meaning to do a quick writeup about the <a href=\"https://shop.boox.com/products/palma\">Boox Palma</a> here as part of one of these posts, and in the last couple of weeks it feels like its press footprint has just exploded. Bump favorite David Pierce <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24184777/boox-palma-e-ink-smartphone-reader\">had a nice writeup</a> that referenced <a href=\"https://craigmod.com/roden/091/\">the same Craig Mod post</a> that led me to buy one. I purchased mine a couple of weeks before I went in for my surgery, in April. I thought I might want something smaller than a regular Kindle in the hospital and during my recovery, and that's exactly how I started using mine. Since then, I have been carrying mine in my sling bag everywhere I go. It's a great device for the pool, the waiting room, or while waiting in line, and the battery lasts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:group -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having this device has made me realize how frustrated I am with the lack of any kind of innovation with the Kindles in recent years.

More competition in this market is great, and I hope the press that the Palma is getting turns into more readers. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I highly recommend that one, it's helped me find some really incredible books. I adored this book, which is about a true story of a Siberian Tiger attack in 1997. The book is part history, part detective story, part biology, and all captivating. I learned so much about tigers, the Russian Far East, the relationship between primates and big cats, and the on-the-ground outcomes of perestroika. <em>Add this one to your list.</em> It also led me to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hED1z5NIaK0\">this excellent YouTube documentary</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A reminder that you can find me on <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73109?ref=nav_profile_l\">goodreads</a>.

It's excellent, not just the best Godzilla movie, but a really good movie in it's on right. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've also been watching a lot of music on YouTube while spending my doctor mandated times on the couch here at home.  Lots and lots of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgtSzqR7D0-BgEFcfhrmWVA\">OMA</a>, who do instrumental covers of hip-hop songs, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzxrVV9aXh8\">this video</a> is a good jumping off point for them, but you can't go wrong with anything on their channel. Perfect background music for your day. If you want something a tad more aggressive, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T1h376ktSk\">this live performance by DJ Z-Trip is a classic</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've been enjoying the new multi-column layout that <a href=\"https://www.threads.net\">Threads</a> has released on the web. It works pretty well on iPad as well. I do wish they had lists, like vintage Twitter did, that's how I consumed so much of my Twitter content over the years. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm (still) playing a ton of <a href=\"https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24092672/updated-522-world-of-warcraft-remix-mists-of-pandaria-now-live\">World of Warcraft Remix: Mists of Pandaria</a>. I'm enjoying it so much that I didn't even start playing the new Destiny 2 expansion as planned this week. My gaming time is limited as I am only allowed to sit up for 30-45 minutes at a time.  Still also doing Wordle and Spelling Bee almost every day too. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Super excited that <a href=\"https://sdw.space\">SDW updated his site this week</a>, he's one of the more inspiring folks on my radar. I subscribed. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I listened to a lot of podcasts this week, catching up on the ones I missed. <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/cortex/155\">The State of the Hardware 2024 Episode of Cortex</a> is the one that had me buying a new microphone for future audio pursuits. Really enjoy all the \"State of the\" episodes of Cortex. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Seems like enough for this week. Hope you have a great weekend. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-returns-june-10-2024/\">Really looking forward to WWDC on Monday</a>. Wish I was allowed to travel for it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Mela is from the same developer as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://reeder.app\" target=\"_blank\">Reeder</a>, which is the RSS reader I have used, in conjunction with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://feedbin.com\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://feedbin.com\" target=\"_blank\">Feedbin</a>, as my newsreader or choice for a long while now. Why did I switch? First, Mela just has a much cleaner user interface, feels more current and modern than Paprika, and is more in keeping with my personal taste. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":3888,\"width\":710,\"height\":479,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"media\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"http://bumps.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-27-at-2.43.47-PM.png\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/6bef1e7b26.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3888\" width=\"710\" height=\"479\"></a><figcaption>Mela Main Window</figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Second, because this app comes from the developer of a feed reader, it has the same concept built into it.

I like this workflow better. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Migration from Paprika was very fast and I haven't found any issues with my collection of recipes.

I spend a lot of my time in meetings, and it always seems like I could use more time outside of them for the rest of my job. Everyone seems to agree about this. Meetings are a necessary evil, but they don't have to be wasteful. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A key to making meetings more productive for me has been providing my meeting agenda items to the other person in advance. It does two great things for me. First, it makes me think carefully about what I want to use the time to talk about. Second it makes me organize topics either in order of priority if I think that time is a consideration, or in a flow that makes sense for the conversation. Finally, it makes me prep for the meeting and identifies any prep work that I need to do to get ready for the meeting. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have a fairly simple system for collecting potential agenda items. I keep an agenda folder in whichever notes app I am currently using, for instance Apple Notes or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://bear.app\" target=\"_blank\">Bear</a>. I'm currently using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://noteplan.co\" target=\"_blank\">NotePlan</a> all day, and should probably blog about that at some point. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For each person or group who I meet with on a regular basis, I have a separate note in an \"Agendas\" folder, even if those meetings are sporadic.

I generally try and do it well before the meeting, this allows the other person or people to think about the topics and prepare if need be. There are times, however, when I am just using that list in the moment to make sure I don't miss something. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A week later, or whenever I need to meet with that person or group again, I‚Äôm also able to see what we discussed last time, and can leverage that to follow up on any items that require more conversation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This system is pretty simple, but it has worked really well for me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

In the last month, they added new Daiquiri and Bee's Knees cocktails to the lineup, and these two are both a welcome taste of Summer. I am not recommending their Margarita though.

Each week they change their menu, introducing a new meat burrito, a new veggie burrito and a new frozen burrito, typically all named in some theme. (This week is Steve Martin themed.)

I've really enjoyed spending time with my family, and focusing on what's important rather than immediate. I'm at the very beginning of my job search, and will likely post more about that here soon, as I need to do some work on my CV first.

Additionally, I have wanted to finally move all the entries into a single CMS. With the 22nd anniversary of this site looming in a couple of weeks, now seemed as good a time as any to try and get this stuff squared away. The site has been on the current host since 2010, and  with the advent of cloud hosting, I can actually reduce my cost and greatly improve the speed of the site, which is really terrible at the moment. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Previously, most of the entries that were before March 2000, when I switched the site over to Blogger/Radio Userland as a backend, were sitting in either a flat file, or on <a href=\"http://radio-weblogs.com/0100237/\">this server</a>, which is still somehow up and running. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Over the last two weeks, I have manually been bringing those older entries over to this existing server.

It's allowed me to stay up to date on several stories that are outside of my interest area. They do a really great job, and on a week like this one, with bucketloads of CES news, it helps me wade through the cruft to get to the interesting stuff. ¬†The host,¬†<a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianmcc\">Brian McCollough</a>, weaves his own humorous delivery into the stories, and that makes taking the medicine of tech news a bit easier as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3226} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/77678db1a9.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3226\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm completely entranced by Reuben Wu's photography.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We‚Äôre at the end of the year, and I‚Äôve been contemplating doing some year end \"top\" posts. One that seemed pretty easy to write was one about the pens that I have used and loved this year.  Once I started writing the below, though, it ended up not being nearly as simple as I expected. I decided that I would limit myself to five pens, or at least models of pen.¬†</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I say ‚Äúused and loved‚Äù because, for me, pens are used in a variety of contexts, and my most used pens, while I should and do love using them, aren‚Äôt the only pens that I have loved using this year. Also, this is all about me, and how I use pens, pens are a personal taste, and what works for me may or may not work for you, I'm a weirdo. So take this with a grain of salt before you run out and buy any of the below.¬†</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3191,\"align\":\"left\",\"width\":339,\"height\":452} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/36b3c4d018.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3191\" width=\"339\" height=\"452\"></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To start with the easiest to identify. In my work bag, I carry a simple zip up pen/pencil case from United Bees that I picked up at <a href=\"http://maidofmight\">Maido in San Francisco</a> a couple of years ago. This case is filled with two varieties of the¬†Uni-ball Signo pen in a variety of colors. I use these pens in my daily work life more than any other pen I own. <a href=\"https://www.jetpens.com/search?q=Uni-ball+Signo+Needle+UM-151ND+Gel+Pen+-+0.38+mm&amp;v=2\">The Uni-ball Signo UM-151 Gel Pen ¬†in the 0.38 mm</a> has been the mainstay of my work writing for several years, and last year, they introduced the¬†<a href=\"https://www.jetpens.com/search?q=Uni-ball+Signo+Needle+UM-151ND&amp;v=2\">Uni-ball Signo Needle UM-151ND Gel Pen</a>, which is a 0.38 needlepoint version of the same pen. As you can see from the picture, the colors are all over the map, but I do tend to always use one of the darker colors and one of the lighter colors together, for instance Blue Black and Mandarin Orange go together very nicely, giving me a highlight color in my bullet journal, and visually keeping things interesting. I have to say that the Blue Black and Green Black are my favorites. ¬†To be honest, I was a little surprised when I dumped the bag and there was only one Blue Black pen in there, I guess it's time to buy more! I typically order these from Jet Pens, and there's a large vessel in my home office that is also full of these pens.¬†</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next most obvious pen that I have used and loved this year is the one that's in my pocket every day. It's paired with <a href=\"http://bumps.wpengine.com/2013/12/review-ddc-stuff-sheath/\">my Stuff Sheath</a>, and hasn't been dethroned from my daily carry in about three years, although I have tried several other options. This pen is the <a href=\"https://www.sunderlandmw.com/collections/frontpage/products/sunderland-mk1-black-anodized\">Sunderland Mk1</a> from <a href=\"https://www.sunderlandmw.com\">Sunderland Machine Works</a>. In the age of Kickstarter pens, I have yet to find <a href=\"https://www.sunderlandmw.com/pages/sunderland-mk1-details\">a better designed and engineered pen</a> in this class. Especially notable are the lack of exposed threads on the grip inside the pen, and the high quality clip that they provide. I use the refill out of a¬†<a href=\"https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Juice-Gel-Pen-0.38-mm-Blue-Black/pd/10692\">Pilot¬†Juice Gel Pen - 0.38 mm - Blue Black</a> in this pen. It's been my refill of choice in Pilot G2 compatible pens for as long as I've known about it, and I think I have <a href=\"https://www.penaddict.com\">the Pen Addict himself</a> to thank for turning me on to it. While I have this pen body in both nickel and black, I tend to use the black one a lot more. ¬†One other pen that I did use as my daily pocket pen was <a href=\"https://www.schondsgn.com/collections/pens/products/classic-machined-pen?variant=14738221072430\">the Schon DSGN pen in Punk Rock pink and black</a>. This pen is a stunner, and really well made too. Unfortunately it fell out of my pocket on a business trip, I think in a Lyft, and it's gone. I did really enjoy using it. In the end the sweet gel refill that fits in the Sunderland would have won out over the ballpoint in any case. ¬†Sorry that the Sunderland pen is currently sold out, but maybe they will make more soon. I wouldn‚Äôt mind picking up another color too.¬†</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3194} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/1af1bb67f5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3194\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next pen is one that I just love to use on a regular basis, the <a href=\"https://products.ystudiostyle.com/products/ihenjdpghjokrj40x9uvkh1mci55pc-lly85-fgngj-c5ajt-6yycf\">ystudio Brassing Portable Fountain Pen.</a>¬†Mine is a Fine nib.

I own a few Sailor pens, and a couple of other Pro Gear pens, but this one is just the best looking pen I own, period, in my opinion. ¬†I'm borrowing someone else's image of it, because I haven't been able to take a picture of this pen that truly does it justice.¬†</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3210} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/c2cb388570.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3210\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's one of those things where I missed the release of this pen, which is a part of <a href=\"https://lepens.wordpress.com/2018/05/07/sailor-cocktail-series/\">Sailor's Cocktail Series</a>, in 2016, and then realized that I really wanted one, but months went by, and I couldn't find anyone who had any intention of selling one. I had pretty much given up on ever getting one. Then, by complete coincidence through a friend in Seattle (thank you again!) I found out one was available and bought it immediately. ¬†Since then, it's remained in my pen setup, and I don't think that will change anytime soon. Sailor just make great product, and this one is my favorite that they've made in recent memory. I have no idea what it would take to knock it out of it's spot, but it's my top pen. ¬†</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, here we are, at the end of the list and at the end of the year.

I've adopted them for my¬†<a href=\"https://bulletjournal.com\">Bullet Journal</a>, and the format seems to be perfect for my simple adaptation of the system.

The covers of these notebooks are a waxed stock that develops cool character as you beat it up. These aren't cheap, but are a high quality product. ¬†They ship from Japan, so you need to be a little patient with arrival timing.¬†</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As it's December, it's time for a new \"planner plan\" for 2019. This year, I am straying from the <a href=\"https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2019/all_about/planner/\">Hobonichi Techo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2019/all_about/weeks/\">Hobonichi Weeks</a> that I have been using for the last few years and giving the <a href=\"https://www.baum-kuchen.net/collections/jibun-techo\">Jibun Techo</a> system a try. ¬†I bought a fairly expensive setup from one of my favorite online stationary retailers, <a href=\"https://www.baum-kuchen.net\">Baum-Kuchen,</a>¬†that is centered on the B6 Slim format and includes a BK x The Superior Labor leather case. If you want to get an idea on how one might use this planner,¬†<a href=\"https://www.baum-kuchen.net/blogs/analogue-stories/jibun-techo-paper-comparison\">here's a great article</a> detailing some of the features of this cool planner setup with good shots of the folios and some ink tests, if that's of interest. ¬†There are more similar stories of how people are using this planner <a href=\"https://www.baum-kuchen.net/blogs/analogue-stories/tagged/jibun-techo\">here</a>. I'm hopeful that I will stick with daily use of this system better this year than the last couple of years with the Hobonichis. I purposely went for something smaller to ensure that I will carry it around. The Ro-Biki notebook that I am using for the Bullet Journal fits in the case with only a small amount sticking out.¬†</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3181} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/a9b55318c8.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3181\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've also become interested in the idea of keeping a five year journal, and since I've just hit a big birthday, this year seems as good a time to really start and lean into this idea. It pairs well with my current interest in Stoicism and reflection. For this purpose, I have chosen the <a href=\"https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/5year/index.html\">Hobonichi 5-Year Techo A6</a>. ¬†This size is currently available from <a href=\"https://www.jetpens.com/Hobonichi-5-Year-Techo/ct/5375\">Jet Pens</a>¬†if you don't want to order it all the way from Japan. ¬†</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3183,\"align\":\"left\",\"width\":373,\"height\":280} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/60761c428e.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3183\" width=\"373\" height=\"280\"></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lastly, for now, I have been a fan of <a href=\"https://thejamesbrand.com/\">The James Brand</a> for a while. I carry their <a href=\"https://thejamesbrand.com/stories/the-elko\">Elko knife</a> in my pocket all the time, use one of <a href=\"https://thejamesbrand.com/stories/the-hook\">their key hooks</a> for the daily carry of my keys, and own a couple of their other knives. So I was really interested, and immediately ordered the <a href=\"https://shop.thejamesbrand.com/products/the-benton-ltd\">LTD Benton pen</a> when it was released. A sweetener is that it comes with a limited run of 600 set of Field Notes books that match the pen. If you know me at all, you know that I had to have this pen, and those sweet sweet notebooks. I really like the super clean lines of the pen, which is a ballpoint out of the box. My only reservation on recommending this is that the click mechanism for the pen is plastic, which is not something I really expect in a pen that costs this much. Having said that, I am happily using mine.¬†</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

We're taking the kids to Walt Disney World for a week the following week. ¬†Hopefully I can still get some of those sweet sweet XOXO Field Notes if they make them.\n\nSee you next week? ¬†I hope so.\n\n¬†\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve been thinking since last weekend that I should write something up about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ELEAGUE¬†CS:GO Major<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that ¬†just happened. This event was a watershed week for our business, but also a marker in my career. ¬†This is from my perspective, and I should be clear that this is from me, not my employer. Any opinions are my opinions, and not theirs. The facts belong to us all though.</p>\n<p>For those who might not be familiar, or weren&rsquo;t following along, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this tournament<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was one of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the most successful in esports history<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a number of ways. It was the first CS:GO Major tournament with a televised Final, which was on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TBS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> here in the US. It was a tournament with some of the best and most competitive gameplay in the history of these tournaments, something we clearly can&rsquo;t take credit for, but which is a testament to the state of competitive CS:GO. A team named Astralis triumphed in the end, and during that final amazing match, we broke the all time Twitch maximum concurrent users record for a single channel, smashing the previous high mark by over 200,000, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->becoming the first channel to ever go over 1 million concurrents<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. ¬†There&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an awesome Instagram video<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, captured by a Twitch engineer friend, which captures my awkward enthusiasm in the moment that we crested that 1 million mark.</p>\n<p>The tournament was held here in Atlanta, first at the ELEAGUE studio on our campus¬†in midtown, with the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals then being held at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fox Theatre<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a venue at which I have attended concerts, plays, and even a movie or two. It was incredibly cool to work an event in my adopted hometown of almost twenty years. While I have worked many NBA All-Star games and golf events while working for Turner, none of them have ever been here in Atlanta. That somehow made this more real and meaningful for me.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In many ways, this ¬†event was no different, from a work perspective, than one of the seven NBA &ldquo;season starts&rdquo; I worked on, or an NBA All-Star Weekend, or a PGA Championship, or the Ryder Cup that I wrote the software for onsite the week of the tournament. This event left a huge 14-day gaping hole in my life, every waking moment those 14 days I was thinking about or doing work. We spent well over a hundred hours the week of the tournament getting ready for each day, working the competition, and making sure that things were updated at the end of the night. These kind of hours have an impact of those around us, and I am more cognizant of that than ever these days. I&rsquo;m not the only one in our home who is exhausted from the long days. I missed my kids and my wife, and they assure me that they missed me. When working with live sports or live events, this is how it is, what it takes to be successful. There are a multitude of details that need to be carefully tended to, and it has to be on a specific time scale that is not negotiable. ¬†I am incredibly proud of the entire team that worked on this event. There were no major outages, our Twitch stream stayed up with no downtime. We ran our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Game Command player<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for more matches in a week than we&rsquo;ve ever run it before. In fact, I believe we ran it for more hours for the Major than every other time we&rsquo;ve run it combined.</p>\n<p>So with all this background information, what did this event mean to me? To understand that, I need to provide just a little more context. First, it was the culmination of an 18th month journey for me. I was asked to first help with, and then work on, Turner&rsquo;s esports initiatives.

				"content_text": "<img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-3022\" src=\"https://bump.micro.blog/uploads/2024/97c7fde48b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\">I've been thinking since last weekend that I should write something up about the <a href=\"http://www.eleague.com/major\">ELEAGUE¬†CS:GO Major</a> that ¬†just happened. This event was a watershed week for our business, but also a marker in my career. ¬†This is from my perspective, and I should be clear that this is from me, not my employer. Any opinions are my opinions, and not theirs. The facts belong to us all though.\n\nFor those who might not be familiar, or weren't following along, <a href=\"http://wiki.teamliquid.net/counterstrike/ELEAGUE/2017/Major\">this tournament</a> was one of <a href=\"http://www.eleague.com/news/2017/2/3/eleague-csgo-major-atlanta-infographic#XIW.AdEp1uq2\">the most successful in esports history</a> in a number of ways. It was the first CS:GO Major tournament with a televised Final, which was on <a href=\"http://www.tbs.com\">TBS</a> here in the US. It was a tournament with some of the best and most competitive gameplay in the history of these tournaments, something we clearly can't take credit for, but which is a testament to the state of competitive CS:GO. A team named Astralis triumphed in the end, and during that final amazing match, we broke the all time Twitch maximum concurrent users record for a single channel, smashing the previous high mark by over 200,000, and <a href=\"https://pvplive.net/c/eleague-breaks-twitchtv-streaming-record-upon-astr\">becoming the first channel to ever go over 1 million concurrents</a>. ¬†There's <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BP3G8rClKjK/?taken-by=bump\">an awesome Instagram video</a>, captured by a Twitch engineer friend, which captures my awkward enthusiasm in the moment that we crested that 1 million mark.\n\nThe tournament was held here in Atlanta, first at the ELEAGUE studio on our campus¬†in midtown, with the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals then being held at the <a href=\"http://foxtheatre.org\">Fox Theatre</a>, a venue at which I have attended concerts, plays, and even a movie or two. It was incredibly cool to work an event in my adopted hometown of almost twenty years. While I have worked many NBA All-Star games and golf events while working for Turner, none of them have ever been here in Atlanta. That somehow made this more real and meaningful for me.\n\n<a href=\"http://bumps.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/C28_IQsWEAA3sJN.jpg-large.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-3036 aligncenter\" src=\"https://bump.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cb6589d44b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"535\" height=\"287\"></a>In many ways, this ¬†event was no different, from a work perspective, than one of the seven NBA \"season starts\" I worked on, or an NBA All-Star Weekend, or a PGA Championship, or the Ryder Cup that I wrote the software for onsite the week of the tournament. This event left a huge 14-day gaping hole in my life, every waking moment those 14 days I was thinking about or doing work. We spent well over a hundred hours the week of the tournament getting ready for each day, working the competition, and making sure that things were updated at the end of the night. These kind of hours have an impact of those around us, and I am more cognizant of that than ever these days. I'm not the only one in our home who is exhausted from the long days. I missed my kids and my wife, and they assure me that they missed me. When working with live sports or live events, this is how it is, what it takes to be successful. There are a multitude of details that need to be carefully tended to, and it has to be on a specific time scale that is not negotiable. ¬†I am incredibly proud of the entire team that worked on this event. There were no major outages, our Twitch stream stayed up with no downtime. We ran our <a href=\"http://www.eleague.com/game-command/#zCJamxK26Zqw\">Game Command player</a> for more matches in a week than we've ever run it before. In fact, I believe we ran it for more hours for the Major than every other time we've run it combined.\n\nSo with all this background information, what did this event mean to me? To understand that, I need to provide just a little more context. First, it was the culmination of an 18th month journey for me. I was asked to first help with, and then work on, Turner's esports initiatives. I had an amazing job working on the NBA's products in the US at the time, and I personally took a big chance on esports because I was passionate about it and ready for something new. I had no idea what it would turn into for Turner, and there were no promises about what my role would be moving forward. We started 18 months ago with a vision for what we wanted to do, and the rest has been a wild ride right into this weekend.\n\nI could have never imagined that Valve, the publisher of CS:GO, would choose us to host a Major in our first year of existence. I couldn't have guessed, even¬†the morning of the Final, that we would break the single channel traffic record on Twitch. So much of that relies on the quality of the matches, and the interest of the fans. If the match had ended after two maps, we never would have broken the record. In any case, even if we hadn't broken that record, we've accomplished so much in a short period of time, starting from nothing, building a team, hosting events. Not everything has been perfect, nor has every decision been a winner, but we've learned from every mistake, and taken all the fan feedback very seriously, and I think it shows. That's how we roll.\n\nSo, this meant¬†a lot to me, more in some ways than anything I have helped build in my career. ¬†I may not work in esports forever, but the memory of this event, especially, across everything we've done with ELEAGUE in it's first year, will always be with me, a reminder that if you just keep going and try hard, and do your best, good things happen.\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n",

I replaced it with an iPhone 6s Plus, which arrived on launch day, but, due to some work travel, I have only had it since Sunday, for five days. Here are some high level observations from those five days of using this new device.</p>\n<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m quite pleased with the new device itself, especially the obvious hardware improvements. Having said that, and I have had every iPhone to date, this was the least smooth transition from one phone to another on the software side. I am still working on getting my new phone to the place my old phone already was.

I purchased an Apple silicone case, I have been very happy with the 2014 silicone case that my work iPhone 6 Plus is in. I am a little disappointed in the 2015 silicone case, it&rsquo;s got a smoother finish, and feels less grippy in your hand. As a result, I feel the phone slipping in my hand a little when I am not expecting it. I may end up getting another case that has a better tactile feel to it.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Touch ID<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it&rsquo;s significantly faster with the new phone for both Apple Pay and unlocking the device. It&rsquo;s so fast, in fact, that I am sometimes accidentally unlocking the device when I wanted to wake the phone up to see the time.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3D Touch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seems to have a ton of potential. It¬†turns out that I am a &ldquo;hard presser&rdquo; to begin with, and so my long touches are often being interpreted as a 3D Touch.

It will take even longer for me to get into the routine of thinking to use it.</p>\n<p>The camera is noticeably better, and was one of my main reasons for upgrading the phone. Focus is faster, and low light photos look better to me. I am not sure that I am that enchanted with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Live Photos<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but that may just be that I haven&rsquo;t taken many yet. Since a lot of what I do with my pictures is sharing via Instagram and Facebook, I am not sure I will use Live Photos much until they are supported on those platforms.</p>\n<p>So now a few words about the transition from my iPhone 6 to this new phone, which has not been a good experience. First, I was a part of the iOS 9 public beta this Summer. Not the developer releases, but the public beta. I did this because I thought it would mean a smoother landing when everything came out this fall. I was wrong. They rolled the people in the iOS 9 public beta right onto 9.1. Once you have backed up on 9.1, you can&rsquo;t restore onto 9. So I had to start with my last good backup from earlier this Summer. I understand what running a beta means, that there may be sharp edges. I think someone at Apple should have thought through the customer experience before just rolling everyone on to 9.1.</p>\n<p>The transition between phones for¬†Ô£øWatch is terrible. You have to un-pair your watch from the phone, deleting everything off the watch, then re-pair it with your new phone, finally restoring from whatever your last backup was, and losing some data pretty much no matter what you do. So much room for improvement here.</p>\n<p>Finally, I have relied on the Health app and Activity app as my primary activity and fitness trackers for the last few months. Shame on me for not looking into this more, but that data does not get backed up via iCloud backup. You can back it up by doing an encrypted iTunes backup, which I will now be forced to switch to. There is a way to migrate this data using two third party apps, and I am going to spend the time to try and do that this weekend. Very disappointing from a user experience standpoint though, seems like they are making the customer do too much work.

				"title": "iPhone 6 and 6 Plus Reviews",
				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Last night, the people who were among the select group of writers to receive review units of the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were finally allowed to release their hands on reviews of¬†the new devices.</p>\n<p>Every year, I find this night a little overwhelming as I try to read and digest the opinions of a catalog of people who I trust, and, in some cases, revere, for their opinions on this stuff. This is kind of hilarious in that every previous year at this point I&rsquo;ve already ordered my device. ¬†This year, however, more than any other, I was reading these reviews hoping that I haven&rsquo;t made the wrong decision in which device I ordered. Really for the first time in the iPhone&rsquo;s history, there are two &ldquo;top of the line&rdquo; devices to choose from. Did I get it right?</p>\n<p>I ordered an iPhone 6 Plus at 3:40 am ET last Friday, after 4o frustrating minutes of trying to order a phone while simultaneously reloading Twitter to see if others had been successful. ¬†My reasoning behind choosing the iPhone 6 Plus was that I wanted the extra battery life, and that, given how much I value the pictures I take with the device, that the camera with optical stabilization would be something that I would want.</p>\n<p>I had printed out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the PDF of the devices<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and cut them out. It did nag at me a little that the 6 Plus was the same size as my (work provided) Samsung Galaxy Note 3.¬†When my order went through, the app informed me that my device would be shipping the first week in October. Unacceptable, but I went back to bed anyway.</p>\n<p>The next morning, I found that there were iPhone 6, Space Gray, 128 Gb still available for store pickup at two of my local Apple stores with a 9/19 availability date. I cancelled my iPhone 6 Plus order, and placed one for an iPhone 6 for pick up. (I can&rsquo;t pick mine up until Monday because I am out of town at a family wedding the next few days.) I&rsquo;m hoping that I don&rsquo;t spend much time in the next 12 months regretting that decision. My reasoning was that the iPhone 6 is still a good¬†jump from the iPhone 5S I am using now in terms of size. ¬†We&rsquo;ll see.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s some thoughts on a few reviews from around the web. I don&rsquo;t intend this post to be a summary of the reviews, or a review of reviews, it&rsquo;s mostly¬†my reaction to each.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daring Fireball - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The iPhones 6<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†by John Gruber<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>This review made me feel a little better about my decision to go with the iPhone 6, particularly this part, where he makes his recommendations.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->MacWorld - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus review: Bigger is in fact better (in the right hands)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†by Jason Snell<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s one heck of a line wrapping title. Jason does a great job of putting this set of device releases in the context of the history of iPhone releases at the beginning of the review. He seems to feel almost exactly the same way that Gruber does about the 6 Plus.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>On a side note, Jason Snell has left MacWorld, and has a new site, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six Colors<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. ¬†There are some interesting deeper insights about the screens and display technology in his first article on that site,¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone 6 &amp; iPhone 6 Plus: A tale of scale<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Looking forward to seeing what else he does with his newfound freedom.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Verge - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone 6 Review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by David Pierce, ¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone 6 Plus Review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Nilay Patel<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>First, I think that it was a curious decision to do these as two separate reviews by two different writers. The two reviews above got this right, in my opinion. A single review for both makes for better reading, and they are so similar in so many ways, that this style of review is more efficient for the reader.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 6 review does a good job of putting this phone, and it&rsquo;s size, in the context of the larger market, fairly comparing it to the Android devices that the Daring Fireballs and MacWorlds would typically not mention. ¬†This review has the nicest product photography and better screen shots than any other review I have looked at for these phones as well.

This is kind of hilarious in that every previous year at this point I've already ordered my device. ¬†This year, however, more than any other, I was reading these reviews hoping that I haven't made the wrong decision in which device I ordered. Really for the first time in the iPhone's history, there are two \"top of the line\" devices to choose from. Did I get it right?\n\nI ordered an iPhone 6 Plus at 3:40 am ET last Friday, after 4o frustrating minutes of trying to order a phone while simultaneously reloading Twitter to see if others had been successful. ¬†My reasoning behind choosing the iPhone 6 Plus was that I wanted the extra battery life, and that, given how much I value the pictures I take with the device, that the camera with optical stabilization would be something that I would want.\n\nI had printed out <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/10/printable-iphone-6-pre-order-picker-can-help-you-choose-the-right-size-model\">the PDF of the devices</a>, and cut them out. It did nag at me a little that the 6 Plus was the same size as my (work provided) Samsung Galaxy Note 3.¬†When my order went through, the app informed me that my device would be shipping the first week in October. Unacceptable, but I went back to bed anyway.\n\nThe next morning, I found that there were iPhone 6, Space Gray, 128 Gb still available for store pickup at two of my local Apple stores with a 9/19 availability date. I cancelled my iPhone 6 Plus order, and placed one for an iPhone 6 for pick up. (I can't pick mine up until Monday because I am out of town at a family wedding the next few days.) I'm hoping that I don't spend much time in the next 12 months regretting that decision. My reasoning was that the iPhone 6 is still a good¬†jump from the iPhone 5S I am using now in terms of size. ¬†We'll see.\n\nHere's some thoughts on a few reviews from around the web. I don't intend this post to be a summary of the reviews, or a review of reviews, it's mostly¬†my reaction to each.\n\n<strong>Daring Fireball - <a title=\"Daring Fireball: The iPhones 6\" href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2014/09/the_iphones_6\">The iPhones 6</a>¬†by John Gruber</strong>\n\nThis review made me feel a little better about my decision to go with the iPhone 6, particularly this part, where he makes his recommendations.\n<blockquote>¬†<em>If you simply want a bigger iPhone, get the 4.7-inch iPhone 6. That‚Äôs what it feels like: a bigger iPhone.</em>\n</blockquote>\nIn the rest of the review, the only section that caused a pause of iPhone 6 Plus regret was the one on battery life. The paragraph on Reachability made me even more curious about this feature, that I suspect one has to try to really understand. I liked how much time Gruber spent on how the units fit into your pocket. He covers virtually every aspect that a regular to advanced user would want to know about. I was wondering about this aspect, and he confirmed my concern.\n<blockquote><em>After seven years, it is hard, really hard, to get to used to the new side placement of the sleep/wake button.</em></blockquote>\nThe rest of the review aligns where I would expect it too. If you're looking to spend a few minutes reading a review, this is the one I would start with. He's the man.\n\n<strong>MacWorld - <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/2684242/iphone-6-and-iphone-6-plus-review-bigger-is-in-fact-better-in-the-right-hands.html\">iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus review: Bigger is in fact better (in the right hands)</a>¬†by Jason Snell</strong>\n\nThat's one heck of a line wrapping title. Jason does a great job of putting this set of device releases in the context of the history of iPhone releases at the beginning of the review. He seems to feel almost exactly the same way that Gruber does about the 6 Plus.\n<blockquote><em>That being said, the iPhone 6 Plus is unlike any iPhone before it. Not quite a phone, not yet an iPad, it‚Äôs a tweener of a device that‚Äôs going to be fantastic for some people and completely wrong for others.</em></blockquote>\nThis review then fits into the sort of regular formula for MacWorld reviews, covering off on the various components of the phone experience. It spends some time on the new displays, and comments on the Reachability in the following manner.\n<blockquote><em>Reachability isn‚Äôt the most elegant concept I‚Äôve seen Apple develop, but it does make the size of these phones more manageable when you‚Äôre using only one hand.</em></blockquote>\nThe review minimizes the difference between the Plus camera and the regular 6 camera, except in low light conditions, and largely stays silent on the battery life matter. ¬†Given that the battery life is one of the three major differences in models, I was disappointed that MacWorld didn't do more with it. Overall, this review didn't invoke iPhone 6 regret in the least.\n\nOn a side note, Jason Snell has left MacWorld, and has a new site, <a href=\"http://sixcolors.com\">Six Colors</a>. ¬†There are some interesting deeper insights about the screens and display technology in his first article on that site,¬†<a href=\"http://six-colors.com/post/2014/09/iphone-6-iphone-6-plus-a-tale-of-scale.html\">iPhone 6 &amp; iPhone 6 Plus: A tale of scale</a>. Looking forward to seeing what else he does with his newfound freedom.\n\n<strong>The Verge - <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6154975/iphone-6-review\">iPhone 6 Review</a> by David Pierce, ¬†<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6155009/apple-iphone-6-plus-review\">iPhone 6 Plus Review</a> by Nilay Patel</strong>\n\nFirst, I think that it was a curious decision to do these as two separate reviews by two different writers. The two reviews above got this right, in my opinion. A single review for both makes for better reading, and they are so similar in so many ways, that this style of review is more efficient for the reader.\n\nThe iPhone 6 review does a good job of putting this phone, and it's size, in the context of the larger market, fairly comparing it to the Android devices that the Daring Fireballs and MacWorlds would typically not mention. ¬†This review has the nicest product photography and better screen shots than any other review I have looked at for these phones as well. It talks more about iOS 8 than the previous two as well, mentioning Spotlight for instance.\n<blockquote><em>I‚Äôm particularly smitten with Spotlight, which now includes the App Store, web, local, and other search results as you type. It‚Äôs become my go-to way to find anything; it‚Äôs much faster than opening Safari or dealing with Siri, which can be fantastically useful but remains hard of hearing.</em></blockquote>\nFor me, the addition of the app store to Spotlight closes a Radar that I filed a very long time ago. I've always thought this belonged there.\n\nThe iPhone 6 plus review did cause me some regret. Particularly this section on battery.\n<blockquote><em>Huge phones get to have huge batteries, and the iPhone 6 Plus is a huge phone with a huge battery: I consistently got about two days of battery life from the 6 Plus in regular daily use ‚Äî slightly more than the day and a half we got from the iPhone 6</em></blockquote>\nDoing the iPhone 6 Plus as a separate review did allow The Verge to dive a little deeper into the software advantages of that lovely large screen. ¬†Again, some regret was felt, but not in a fatal dosage.\n\nI would be doing The Verge a disservice if I didn't mention how well done the video reviews are. Both are excellent, and I found myself wondering why¬†some of the other publications/sites don't do this, as it's way more revealing about a product like the iPhone than a written review with some screenshots. ¬†I especially ¬†enjoyed the shot of the reviewer walking by the line at the 5th Avenue Apple Store in Manhattan, walking past the people waiting in line for the iPhone 6 while talking on the iPhone 6. ¬†Funny.\n\n<strong>New York Times -¬†<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/technology/personaltech/review-and-video-with-new-iphone-6-and-6-plus-its-whats-inside-that-counts.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0\">Review and Video: With Big New iPhones, It‚Äôs the iOS 8 Software Inside That Counts</a> by Molly Wood</strong>\n\nThis one is another combo written review and video review in a single page. The written review sticks to the basics, and really steers clear of making a recommendation, as I think you would expect from a more mainstream media review.\n\nThe video review is excellent, and seeing the phones in her hands was great. It made me realize just how huge the iPhone 6 Plus is going to be for people with smaller hands. (Which I don't have.) The video review has a lot more flavor and opinion to it, and I wish that had come through more in the written review.\n\nNeither review impacted my possible buyer's remorse.\n\n<em>I'm pushing this post out, but plan on adding additional reviews today as time allows. ¬†There are a lot of reviews. - RO 11:44 AM¬†ET</em>\n",

It struck a chord with me, and so I decided to give it a try for a couple of months and see if it worked for me.  I ran out and picked up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moleskine Evernote Smart Notebook<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, thinking that I would combine this with Evernote for a longer term searchable archive of my daily productivity notes.

This coupled with the task of physically writing the items down each day engrains the list in my mind as I move through my day.  There&rsquo;s a huge difference for me mentally between typing something and writing it down, and my retention of things I write down seems to be much higher. What I found, after using it for a month or two is that the results in productivity were definitely tangible, and the results in a more peaceful work mind were even more useful.

				"content_html": "<p>&ldquo;Well, fuck them, and fuck that.&rdquo; - <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Marco Arment has some great thoughts on the Google Reader shutdown<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been hard for me to be analytical about this shutdown because it made me pretty mad at Google, even though I don&rsquo;t really have a right to be mad. I used Reader for years, and harder than most people who used it daily. I read my stories mainly via the various apps I used to read news hooked to the API, and hardly ever logged on to the web interface. I got a ton of value out of the Google Reader ecosystem over the years, and I never paid even a single dime to Google. (I have paid a fair amount of money to RSS Reader developers over the years, but that&rsquo;s unrelated.)</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve found &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; replacements for the tools I was already using, and I am purposely using a backend rss service that I can pay for.

				"content_text": "\"Well, fuck them, and fuck that.\" - <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2013/07/03/lockdown\"> Marco Arment has some great thoughts on the Google Reader shutdown</a>.\n\nIt's been hard for me to be analytical about this shutdown because it made me pretty mad at Google, even though I don't really have a right to be mad. I used Reader for years, and harder than most people who used it daily. I read my stories mainly via the various apps I used to read news hooked to the API, and hardly ever logged on to the web interface. I got a ton of value out of the Google Reader ecosystem over the years, and I never paid even a single dime to Google. (I have paid a fair amount of money to RSS Reader developers over the years, but that's unrelated.)\n\nI've found \"good enough\" replacements for the tools I was already using, and I am purposely using a backend rss service that I can pay for.

I honestly felt like we could have built anything we were asked to.  I wish that the senior management understood the value of keeping a development team intact, regardless of the product that they were working on.  This is water under the bridge now, and I can only hope that I might teach my superiors to value development teams more in the future.  Building a team, building process, and learning how to work with a large team of bright people is a challenge, and starting from scratch is a little discouraging, but I have so much learning to apply that it is also exciting.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am working now for Turner Sports.  I will be working on technology related to the NBA.com licensing deal.  It's a pretty exciting project, with agressive deadlines already, and some new technology that hasn't even been created yet.

The single most important thing to keep in mind, which he does not come out and explicitly say, is that you should not immediately trust anything online.  That email that seems to be from your bank, or ebay or paypal probably is not.  Look carefully at links before following them, and don't trust any source of information or software without first verifying that they are legitimate. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis can sometimes be very hard for a non-technical user to figure out, but I recommend that you err on the side of caution.</p>\n",

It's got a different approach to the storage of the items, and I honestly like it's UI a bit more than Yojimbo's currently.  I imported all the items in my Yojimbo database in about five minutes, and I was off using it. Since it doesn't support .Mac syncing like Yojimbo, I set up some Chronosync scripts to copy the application, it's preferences, and the directories where it stores it's data to my 160Gb iPod, and to sync this stuff back on my laptop and Mac Pro.  It's a somewhat tough call as far as which of these two apps I will end up sticking with long term, especially with Yojimbo being updated.  Together has a few annoyances, and there's no user community like the mailing list that Bare Bones has for Yojimbo.  Of course, I am still using Devonthink Pro to keep anything I might want access to long term.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor reference purposes, here's <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=2088632085&amp;size=l\">a screenshot of my Together UI</a>, and here's <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=2088632103&amp;size=l\">one of my Yojimbo UI</a>.</p>\n",

(The Wikipedia article refers to it as dubstep.  I don't really know what that is.)  It's pretty dark stuff, music for abandoned cities, but at times it approaches clubiness.  I couldn't stop listening to it last week.  \n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://eliotlipp.net/\">Eliot Lipp</a> might be the greatest electronic musician you have never heard of before.  I referred to his newest album as the \"soundtrack of my fall 2007\".  I'm still listening to it.  It's very beat driven, and mostly stripped down, great for putting your headphones on and getting some stuff done, or just for hanging out reading.  If you want to check him out, I recommend starting with his The Days EP from 2006. (<a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=163816627&amp;s=143441\">iTMS</a>) Listen carefully.  My favorite song is definitely \"Koreatown Minimall\" on that EP.\n</p>\n<p>\nObviously, still listening to the Saul WIlliams and Sigur Ros with a regular mix of other stuff thrown in.

It's got an ATI Radeon X1900 XT card in it, and it seems these cards <a href=\"http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1209998&amp;tstart=0\">are prone to overheating</a>.  Using iSlayer's awesome <a href=\"http://www.islayer.com/index.php?op=item&amp;id=28\">iStat menus</a> (pictured above), I watched the Northbridge temperature in the machine go North of 170 degrees F.  \n</p>\n<p>\nMy first inclination on this overheating, since it's something I had only started to see over the last couple of months, was that the video card cooling system might be clogged with dirt.  I took the machine apart last week to put some RAM in, and cleaned the card, which was, in fact dirty.  However, this did not make the problem go away.  Yesterday, I stayed home from work, so I was using the tower all day.  Sure enough, last night it started overheating.  I searched on Google a bit, and it seemed that most of what I found were references to MacBook Pro's overheating.  Thankfully, one of the solutions employed to fix that issue on the laptop also solved my issue.  There's an excellent piece of software named <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/holtmann/eidac/software/smcfancontrol2/index.html\">smcFanControl</a>.  It lets you manually control the fans in your machine.  The stock fan settings in my Mac Pro seemed to be around 500 rpm.  That was clearly not enough to cool my machine, which also has 3 SATA internal drives in it.  I bumped (no pun) the fan rpm's for two of the fans up to 750 rpm.  The cooling issue seems to be completely solved.  I highly recommend both iStat menus and smcFanControl to other Mac Pro owners.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso yesterday, I noticed a strange constant read pattern from the drive bays.  Some of my apps were lagging.  I would type something into an iChat window, but the text wouldn't appear for several seconds.  I spent some time with the <a href=\"http://www.peachpit.com/guides/content.aspx?g=mac&amp;seqNum=182&amp;rl=1\">Activity Monitor</a>, and couldn't find an obvious culprit.  So I rebooted my machine from the Leopard disk and ran Disk Utility.  As is sometimes the case, it found a ton of errors that it coud not repair.  My theory became that all the crashing from the overheating problem was slowly damaging my hard drive file system.  Not the physical drive, but the directory information on it.  In the past I have used Disk Warrior to fix this issue.  Currently, <a href=\"http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/index.html\">Disk Warrior</a> is not compatible with Leopard in that <a href=\"http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/support.html\">it has issues if you run it while booted from a Leopard disk</a>.  Laziness paid off in that I have not upgraded the external utility disk I use for such tasks.  I booted from that disk (Jeter) ran Disk Warrior, and fixed all of the issues.  I recommend keeping an external disk with Tiger on it for such ocassions until the verious troubleshooting vendors update their software, and I highly recommend Disk Warrior.\n</p>\n",

As you can see, I listened to a lot of Sigur Ros this week.  Mainly because Hvarf - Heim was released and listening to it reminded me how much I like Sigur Ros, and so I ended up listening to some of the older stuff too.  Also last week, the J Dilla album, <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=266790524&amp;s=143441\">Jay Loves Japan</a> (iTMS link) became available via the ITMS, and I bought that, and listened to it a couple of times.  It's quite good.  I'm not crazy about the new Jay-Z, and I really did give it a chance.  \n</p>\n",

Chantix seems to make dealing with the physical part of the addiction a non-issue.  The first day without smokes is always tough, and today has been no exception, but in a sense it's easy because, despite the discomfort, you are very focused on the fact that you are quitting, at least I am.  I am using some visualization to help myself too, something that I must have picked up somewhere, but don't remember reading about.  I also feel like I am set up better to quit now than I have ever been.  Alcohol should be a non-issue, and I live with a lovely non-smoking, stable woman who has promised to be supportive. \n</p>\n<p>\nMy reasons for quitting are myriad.  In the end, I want to live.  I care some about the three dollars and fifty cents a day I was spending on cigarettes, but I'm far more interested in tasting my food. It's scary getting ready to quit and stepping off that ledge like I did last night, but the payoff, while not immediate in some cases, is totally worth it. In summary, I am not looking forward to the challenges of the next six weeks of mental wrestling, but I am prepared to deal with them and I will.  You can't stop me, you can only hope to contain me.</p>\n",

				"title": "What It's Like Being the Guildmaster of a WoW Raiding Guild (Part 1)",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>\nI've referred to the fact that I am the Guildmaster(GM) of a World of Warcraft Raiding guild before.  You learn a lot about yourself and other people being the leader of a group of 70 people, and I thought I would write a couple of posts about my experiences.  World of Warcraft is unlike any game before it in some ways, although it takes a lot of its lineage from the other MMO's that came before it.  \n</p>\n<p>\nFirst some basic information about our guild.  It's roughly two years old.  I was not the original GM, but I was one of the founding members.  I was the Raid Leader for the first six months of the guild's existence.  I will talk a little more about that role later, but I had the role of GM sort of thrust upon me when the membership was unhappy with the original GM.  I didn't really want to be GM, and I think in some ways that has made me a much better GM.  We have had, at most, about a hundred members.  \n</p>\n<p>\nWe raid four days a week on a regular schedule.  Most of our members are adults, and I have had everything from State Department diplomats to lawyers and doctors to college students and warehouse workers in the guild.  I would guess that the average age of our guild would be something like 28.  Raiding, for those who don't know anything about games like WoW, is when a large group of players get together to tackle game encounters that require everyone in the twenty five man group (it used to be 40) to effectively play their role well.  The encounters range from very simple ones which last 5-10 minutes, to very complicated ones that last up to 30 minutes.  The learning curve of a particular encounter can be anywhere from a couple of hours to a few weeks.  When your guild has mastered an encounter, they move on to the next one in the learning ladder, and the previous one is said to be \"on farm status\".\n</p>\n<p>\nOur guild ranked around 500 in the world and 200 in the US in terms of progression.  That's not terrible by any means, but it's not nearly as hardcore as some folks.  In the past, we cleared Molten Core, Blackwing Lair, AQ40, and almost had cleared Naxx when Burning Crusade came out.  Currently, we are working on <a href=\"http://www.wowwiki.com/Kael'thas_Sunstrider\">Kael'thas Sunstrider</a>, the last boss in Tempest Keep, who is sort of a gateway boss to the second half of raiding in Burning Crusade.  It's a brutal encounter, with 5 phases that require learning.  We've been working on it for three or four weeks now, and should finally get it done in the next day or two.  On our particular server, we are the third most progressed guild, and one of the oldest raiding guilds.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo, with that background, here's some observations.  First, being a GM can be a very lonely job.  You have to be the voice of reason, the source of discipline, and ultimately keep order where 50-70 personalities are involved.  You have to try and gauge morale while continuously trying encounters and failing over and over until you succeed.  Interestingly enough, this aspect of being a GM is very similar to my day job of managing people.  Once you cross that line into being a boss, your relationships with your guildmates will change.  You now hold the ultimate power where all things guild are concerned.  It requires, above all else, patience.  People want raid invites, and things from the guild bank, and they will leap up and down to do things for you if you ask.  It's tough to remain impartial, and to keep things as fair as you can.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you are a GM of a raiding guild, you are always hiring.  In order to keep pace with the other guilds on your server, you have to keep killing bosses.  If you don't have enough people of one class that is required for an encounter, it can stunt your progression, and people are constantly coming and going.  People decide they want to play with an old friend and leave your guild, or get a \"better offer\" from a more progressed guild.  Recruiting is a full time job, and as a result, I have two officers whose only job is recruitment, which is critical because I don't play every night.  We have a set process for evaluating candidates, and I would say we actually take about 5% of the people who apply when we have openings.  Of course, once you hire someone new, you have to then train them in the various encounters you already have on farm status.  It's a never ending treadmill that you just have to get used to as a GM.  \n</p>\n<p>\nReliable infrastructure is important.  It's critical that you have a guild forum, a dkp accounting system and a voice chat server for the guild, and that these three things are reliable.  The forum gives the membership a place to discuss things out of game, a housing for your rules and regulations, and a place to post your \"strategies\" on how bosses get killed.  It also gives your potential applicants a place to post their applications for your evaluation.  A fair dkp system is the lifeblood of any guild.  It's purpose is to make sure that \"loot\" is distributed in a manner that is in line with each person's contribution to the guild.  This can be a real pain in the arse, as you have to then enter four raids worth of attendance and loot every week.  However, it's incredibly important that this get done.  Finally, without voice chat, you won't get very far.  It's critical to succeeding at the complex encounters.  It's also critical to fostering the social relationships that make the game worth playing.\n</p>\n<p>\nI'll do a part two to this soon.  If there are particular things you are curious about, post in the comments, and I will trey to address them.\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nYeah, so I bought this iPhone thing.  Generally, I love it, but I won't waste your time with a lot of observations that are available elsewhere.  I will say that I moved to it from a Samsung Blackjack, and while both have their advantages and disadvantages, I will be sticking with the iPhone.  There are three things that I wish the iPhone had right now that it does not; the ability to tether to my laptop for data, a disk mode, and the ability to use my music as ringtones.  This post is about that last item.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo, right now, you are stuck with the default ringtones, welcome to 1999.  Every phone that I have had for the last 8 or 9 years allowed me to use other ringtones.  That's just dumb from a company that is largely about music these days.  Then, I read <a href=\"http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9736272-7.html\">this article</a> this morning.  So they are going to charge us for ringtones via the iTunes store.  \n</p>\n<p>\nNow, I am no lawyer, nor do I play one on TV, or even want to play one.  This, however, seems like a real issue to me.  I have paid for a lot of music via the iTunes music store.  I already paid for it.  I want to use it as a ringtone on a device that I also paid for.  It seems, to me at least, that this is charging me twice for the same thing.  I wonder aloud if I ponied up some money, if this is a lawsuit that we could win for everyone.  Let me know your thoughts.\n</p>\n",

I went to the office, we deployed the new Super Deluxe patch, and then I headed down to CNN Center for my normal slate of meetings.  In between meetings, I usually find an empty conference room to squat in and do my work.  Today, however, all the rooms were full, so I went to the Omni Hotel, which is connected to CNN, to use their free WiFi network.  I was sitting there, at the top of the escalators, when a single gun shot rang out.  This was followed by a pause, and then three or four more gun shots.  All I remember is picking up my things and running.  Somehow I ended up behind the security door at the suite of offices behind the front desk, where I waited with hotel employees and some other civilians until the situation was safe.  Scary stuff to be sure.</p>\n",

With no press push, no really heavy corporate promotion or anything, we hit a pretty reasonable sized user number.  Second, there are a bunch of new names in the press release that we hadn't announced yet.  Probably the biggest are David Cross, Wayne Brady, Horatio Sanz and Dave Attell.  I'm really looking forward to seeing these guys out on the site, and I am hoping that they interact with the community and other artists the way some of the existing artists are interacting.

I still have a lot to do, but I am now wishing that I had taken a before picture, because the after picture will be pretty cool.  I reran all the cables the right way, put down carpet, put all my devices on a shelf in a unit that now houses the towers and printer as well, set up a new RAID backup system, and reworked the home entertainment part of the office.

				"content_text": "<p>\nSo, at the end of 2005, Turner asked some of us to sit in a conference room.  At first, I was like, \"That sounds boring.\"  After a while though, I realized that it would be a good way to get out of work on PGA.com.  That part was pretty awesome because I had gotten kind of bored working to make sure leaderboards were updated all the time.  Then they started asking us to come with ideas for \"broadband\" projects.  So I went to Wikipedia and looked up broadband.  Then I made some stuff up.  In the end, we came with an idea for a comedy broadband Web site.  It was a pretty good idea, or so I thought.  Then they made me go back to work on the golf Web site.  Then a month went by, and they asked us to start \"fleshing out\" the idea.  I am pretty fleshy, so I was good at that part.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter this, it was a crazy wild ride.  I have always wanted to say that something was a crazy wild ride, so this worked out perfectly for me.  We did some stuff, and then we did some more stuff.  Finally, they decided that this idea was good enough to actually build.  This made me nervous, because it entailed me actually doing work.  It was a pretty big project, and they weren't going to give us much time to get it done.  I had one employee, and no code written.  Over the next four months, I hired a full development team, and worked with three other development teams, and our gifted presentation team to build the site from scratch.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn all seriousness, I am very proud of what our team accomplished, and this project was a time of massive personal growth for me.  There's a lot more we want to do, and we've already started working to improve and enhance what is already out there.  I will definitely write more posts about the many lessons I learned.  In closing, check out Little Michael Jackson.  \n</p>\n\n<object height=\"350\" width=\"400\">  <param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\">  <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.superdeluxe.com/static/swf/share_vidplayer.swf\">\n<param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"id=D81F2344BF5AC7BBA7E4062EAD69EC3C611764094B0758D0\">\n<embed height=\"350\" flashvars=\"id=D81F2344BF5AC7BBA7E4062EAD69EC3C611764094B0758D0\" width=\"400\" src=\"http://www.superdeluxe.com/static/swf/share_vidplayer.swf\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed>\n</object>\n",

I try really hard to keep the most recent versions of everything in DevonThink, but it's virtually impossible for me to keep up with all the updates.  We would use Basecamp, but the lack of versioning makes that feature not as useful.

These wouldn't map directly to Rob's as \"concentrated coolness\" doesn't really apply to Java code.  I can't decide whether these kind of core values are best left to organically develop or whether they should be something that I decide on and then attempt to instill into our efforts.  It seems like they would be truer if I let them develop, then codify them.  Regardless, I think this keynote text is something everyone should read, whether interested in things World of Warcraft or not.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "Well, I got back from Max on Thursday.  It's the following Monday morning, and I think I have had ample time to distill the important things out of the experience.  Let's see if I can successfully now turn those thoughts into prose.\n\n<p>\nMuch of the message from Macromedia this year was about Flex, their next iteration of leveraging the company's crown jewel.  Flex is oriented towards application developers, and its appeal is certainly that it acts as a fairly RAD UI tool.  Flex builder is based on Eclipse.  That sounds great, until you look a little closer and realize that, at least in its Alpha iteration, it only runs on Windows.  What?  Isn't that sort of the point of Java?  To run on any runtime?  That's clearly a BigCo \"we don't get it\" decision.  I would be running the IDE on my machine right now if it would run here.  By the way, I am your target audience, and make platform decisions.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey didn't talk that much about \"Scorpio\", the codename for ColdFusion 8.  They did, however, demo some cool Macromedia developed additions to <a href=\"http://www.cfeclipse.org/index.cfm\">CFEclipse</a>.  I was all excited about this at first. After thinking about it more in light of the above paragraph, I wonder if things like RDS support will be Windows only features when released.  The file browsing that they had built, with it's cool two tabbed interface like Homesite, made me drool.  That, honestly, is probably the one thing that has kept me using Homesite all this time.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere's more to talk about, obviously, like Flash 8.5, and Actionscript 3 and whatnot.  I hope to get in here and add more comments as time allows today and tomorrow.</p>\n",

If any of the software, or any of the servers fail, it is my responsibility, through millions of page views and thousands of updates.  I enter a zone for that week that I wouldn't want to be in all the time.  On Monday, when they finished the tournament due to bad weather on Sunday, I saw the single fastest minute by minute increase in traffic I've ever seen in my career.  I wish I could post the graphical representation of that traffic surge here.  It pushed our server farm to it's limits, we started to saturate the available pipe we had to work with, and just when it seemed like we might be in trouble, the tournament ended and the traffic subsided.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis week, I slowly emerge from the mode I was in.  I'm hoping to update more here starting today.  I'm hoping to see my friends more often for the rest of the summer.

I imagine that most, if not all folks, who pointed to it did not read through the entire posting.  I'm sure they saw the title, which sounds grandiose and interesting, and thought it was worth pointing out.  \n\n<p>\nIf they did read through the entire listing, they would have run into a list of bullet points under the \"requirements\"  section.  These requirements lead me to believe that the job is basically one where this person designs html emails to be sent out to customers.  The title of the job doesn't say this at all.  I believe that this disconnect, the job title that sounds good but says nothing about the job, is a huge issue in corporate America.  Let me single out a couple of specific bullet points for your enjoyment.  There is one that says \"Skills in web publishing, FTP, etc.\"   What does this mean exactly?  Why include something so incredibly general? Do my skills building pages in Microsoft FrontPage and uploading them to a server count? (To be fair they did mention hand coding in another bullet point.)  How about this fine bullet point?  \"Experience working in a marketing environment a plus.\"   I'd imagine that \"marketing environments vary greatly, just as Web Development ones do.  Don't they do a massive disservice to both themselves and people who might apply for the job?  If you want to receive a couple of hundred resumes instead of thousands wouldn't you make things a tad less general?  The last bullet point under requirements says, \"Demonstratable, strong verbal and grammatical skills.\"  I checked a couple of dictionaries here, and could not find \"Demonstratable\" in any of them.  It's ironic that the bullet point that calls for written communication skills contains a word that doesn't exist.  I believe they mean Demonstrable.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt seems to me that the purpose of human resources departments is to speed the time it takes to hire employees, and to find the right resource for each individual position.  In practice, I find that the lack of understanding of the actual position being hired for, and the internal processes by which HR departments tend to run and use to filter resumes, not only slow the hiring process to a crawl, but also make it very unlikely that a person with the correct qualifications will be found and interviewed.  I could be wrong about this, but my anecdotal observations are that the hires I make myself/have made myself through industry networking tend to be much better fits for positions than anyone who staffing companies, technical recruiters or human resource departments manage to find me.  In ten years of working in this industry, I struggle to think of a single person that has been hired through the \"established channels\" whose performance and skills matched those who I went outside these channels to hire.  How do we fix this?  How do we correct things so that a position for an \"HTML Email Developer\" says that, and doesn't create false expectations for the hire, or a pseudo-false entry on that person's resume in the future? \n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, this brings me to another bullet point in the requirements section.  It says \"<em>High degree of productivity and accuracy in a work setting that's characterized by frequent change, shifting priorities, delays, unexpected events, meeting commitments, and changing deadlines.</em>\"  As one of my co-workers here said, \"Good Lord, why would anyone want to apply for that job after reading that?\"  It sounds as if they are apologizing in advance for a broken set of workplace processes.  To some extent, this is a description of any production environment, but including it in the actual job posting is suspect in my opinion.  Wouldn't it be more productive to evaluate this, and communicate it, at the interview stage of the hiring process?  \n</p>\n<p>\nI again apologize for singling this one job posting out. I make this post with the best of intentions, and I mean it to represent an issue that is very general and systemic, in my opinion.  I don't mean to offend anyone in Macromedia HR. I'm sure I could have searched on Monster and found hundreds of other job postings with similar faults.  It's the system in corporations that generates these faults, not the people themselves, and I recognize that fact. I'm interested in hearing other folks comments about this topic.  I could be way off, and my experience could be a rare negative one.  I would be happy to hear that, because the alternative is very depressing.\n</p>\n",

It was fun, but brief, making me realize how much I miss having him around here in Atlanta.  This led directly into our crazy week of work covering The Masters.  A great tournament, with a close ending.  This, of course, equates with tremendous stress in covering that ending.  Immediately after the post-tournament work was done, I spent a day with my cousin Jim and his wife Fatiha.  They are great, smart, interesting folks, and I wish I had been able to spend more than a day with them.  We went out for a delicous and messy Moroccan dinner (Fatiha is Moroccan.) This weekend, I look forward to some decompression, catching up on my reading, and doing laundry.  I also have about ten posts to write here, ranging from local stuff to Meetup.com screwing their best customers.  That will have to wait though.</p>\n",

I have probably turned ten or fifteen people onto that one book, and have never gotten a single bad response from the person.  Almost everyone has gone on the read the entire series.  \n\n<p>  \nI got into an extended discussion about books Saturday night with a couple of friends.  They were talking about the Harry Potter books, and I couldn't help but think those books are overrated. I hear people compare them to the Lord of the Rings books, and it turns my stomach.  I have to fight hard to keep back the book snob in me in conversations like this.  I was told that the series gets a lot better in the third book, and that the quality of her writing really improved at that point.  Since I have only read the first two, I guess I need to pick up the third one and read it to really be able to take part in this discussion actively.  My initial impression was that they were good guilty pleasure books, but I wouldn't put them up in the Tolkein, C.S. Lewis, L'Engle, Robert Jordan,  territory.  I guess, also, that I have probably read more fantasy genre stuff than the people making these claims, and so I have already formed an emotional attachment to other works. (I live here, and you are just visiting.) Finally, it's art, and in my opinion, it should come down to what you enjoy, but making absolute claims requires perspective.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe conversation continued, with one of my friends offering up Tom Clancy as a \"great\" author because of his attention to detail, especially in the military realm.  I've read almost all of Clancy's books, but I cannot claim that he is a great author.  I really enjoyed all of them, but they tend to be formulaic despite their attention to detail.  I would however, buy any new book he writes.  It reminded me, however, of another conversation during bloggers and beer earlier in the week where a friend claimed that the Beastie Boys section of the Kleptones night at the Hip Opera was superior to any of the Beastie Boys works because Queen's music was sonically superior to anything that the Dust Brothers may have done on Paul's Boutique.  While it may be academically superior in a purely mathematical sort of way, that criteria seems, at least to me, a very narrow way of looking at music, which for me is all about the emotional reaction to the work.  The innovation of Paul's Boutique paved the way for the mashup culture we are now enjoying, and that should have some value beyond the sum of it's sonic parts.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis has made me think more about books and music.  The works I enjoy don't always tend to be the most popular, but I stand by them from a quality perspective.  Are these two areas of art analogous?  Is Britney Spears the equivalent of J.K. Rowling?  I tend to believe that I look for some level of innovation in the works that I enjoy.  Not necessarily from an academic perspective, but from an \"original\" way of thinking perspective.  It's difficult for me to restrain my opinions, but they, at times, make me feel like a big snob, whether I have read more books or listened to more music or not.</p>\n",

It is also the first server in our farm that is running CFMX 7.  So I had just gone through three days of server work on this exact topic prior to the meeting.  For a variety of reasons, I had decided that, in addition to going with CFMX 7 for application specific reasons, which I will get into later in this post, we would be better off with the Multiserver configuration of ColdFusion.  This will allow us to sandbox apps in various CF instances, which makes good sense in the environment that we are in.  The install went pretty well, although the documentation from Macromedia, which I read thoroughly before doing anything, is not very good in my opinion.  I found mistakes, which I plan on documenting and getting to Macromedia, and much of the docs assume you are installing the single server configuration.  The MultiServer specific documentation is sparse.  I'm guessing that I am supposed to consult the JRun documentation for some of this information, but the CFMX documentation should point me in that direction, not assume that I know where to look.  \n</p>\n<p>\nThe installer is pretty well written though, and doing the actual installation went very smoothly.  In fact, the documentation inside of the installer does a great job of walking you through things.  However, once you have installed the Multiserver version, gotten it configured to use whichever Web server you are running, and gotten it running from the command line, you realize that something which is in every other version of ColdFusion is missing if you install with this option.  Macromedia supplies no scripts to start JRun and ColdFusion automatically at system startup.  I thought to myself yesterday, no problem, there has to be documentation of the best practice way to do this on MM's site.  After about an hour of searching I realized that this was not the case.  I made a comment on Stephen Erat's site, and he pointed me to <a href=\"http://gregs.tcias.co.uk/jrun_start_up_scripts.cfm\">Greg Stewart's experimental scripts</a> for doing this.  In my opinion, this is not a solution to the problem, I want the vendor to tell me what they recommend.  I know I can write my own shell script to start this configuration, but I find the fact that Macromedia didn't think to supply one of their own, or any guidance for that matter, bothersome.  At the very least, there should be a technote.  After all, they supply a method of doing this for every other version of their product.  I very much would like to see that oversight fixed.  \n</p>\n<p>\nMy single biggest issue with CFMX 6.1 has been Query of Queries, and our team had great hopes that the typing issues we had constantly run into with Query of Queries would be fixed in CFMX 7.  It seems, based on our testing, that the typing engine itself has not changed, which is to say that if you do not specifically type a column (which is new functionality in CFMX 7), it arbitrarily assigns a type to each column based on some data inspection.  This data inspection is not documented anywhere, as far as I can tell.  So the Macromedia solution to the issue was not to fix the typing engine, but rather to add the ability to type columns upon query creation.  I'm not sure that this is the right solution to the issue.  In addition, we have seen behavior where the typing engine assigns a type of \"null\" to a column.  This makes operations involving that column problematic.  I would think that the default type would be some sort of string, like a varchar, but this does not seem to be the case.  This ends up making Q of Q not nearly as useful as it could be.  I know, of course, that there are other, alternate, complex data types that I could use for these operations, but I attempt to map data that fits into query objects to queries.  \n</p>\n<p>\nEven so, we are looking forward to using CFMX 7 moving forward.  There is a bunch of new functionality that is a good fit for us in there, and we plan on exploiting it.  I figured that I would document the two things I have run into so far for Google and others who might run into them.</p>\n",

If anyone works for a publication and wants a qualified photographer onsite at Coachella, I would be a very cheap, available, option.  I have my own professional quality equipment, am already attending, and would love the opportunity to work the show with credentials so that I can get my DSLR into the show.  If you are such a person, or know someone who could give me the hookup in return for some high quality shots of various acts, I would be forever in your debt.  In fact, I will up the ante beyond that.  If you make the connection that gets me credentials, I will buy you an iPod Shuffle 512.  This offer is limited to one person, and is on a first come first served basis.  Thanks.  ( I would be pleased to offer some sample photography, if necessary.)  If all else fails, I will just bring along my small Canon SD camera like last year.</p>\n",

I went to the Apple Store yesterday morning, and picked one up, the 1.42 GHz version. I was very busy with other things yesterday, but set it up in my home office this morning. Everything was pretty seamless, with the set-up wizard copying my documents, settings, and applications over from my Powerbook, which has been my only Mac OS X machine for quite a while. (My last desktop machine from Apple was a Blue and White tower.)  The Mini has a nice footprint on my desk, and has all the horsepower I need to do the various things I will do on it. I have it hooked up to an Apple 20\" Cinema Display, a Microsoft Natural Keyboard, and the Microsoft Intellimouse that is by far my favorite mouse of them all.  All of these items were already on my desk, and I used to hook them up to the Powerbook every night, now I will leave them hooked to the Mini.\n</p>\n<p>\nSince purchasing <a href=\"http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=10464\">the new camera</a> in December, I had been planning on buying another machine to house the many photos I was taking with it and to use as my Photoshop workstation.  On my trip to Maui alone, I took over 2700 pictures. It was clear to me after that trip, and the holidays, that another machine with a big firewire drive hooked up to it would make the most sense for attempting to manage things.\n</p>\n<p>\nI was actually the first person in line at the Atlanta Apple Store.  By the time the store opened at 9 a.m., there were about 40 of us in line.  Unfortunately, the Apple Store was not selling the iPod Shuffle and Mac mini on a first come, first served basis, and I know that this was a huge dissapointment for some of the people in line.  They had no iPod Shuffles to sell to folks who were there, as all of them were allocated to people who signed up for a waiting list, which no one had told yours truly about when I stopped by the previous weekend. The folks at the Apple Store were very helpful though, and went out of their way to make sure that I got the RAM upgrade I wanted. The Lenox store here in Atlanta was more busy than I had ever seen it.  If you want an Airport Extreme or Bluetooth enabled Mac Mini, you will have to order it through the online Apple Store, as those upgrades are not available at the retail locations.  Personally, I think that is a big oversight considering how most people plan on using their Mini's.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Mac Mini is impressively small and well designed.  The footprint is slightly larger than a standard CD case, and it's as tall as a stack of five CD's.  The ports in the back are laid out well, although I wonder why they bothered to include the modem in the device at all.  As far as performance goes, all I have are my anecdotal observations, but it seems slightly faster than my 1.25 GHz Aluminum Powerbook.  The transfer of my 57 Gb of data from my Powerbook using target disk mode took less than an hour.  Overall, I'm quite happy with the purchase.</p>\n",

Last night, we had to go to a second sports bar to find a table, and we were lucky to even get a table at the second bar.  The Falcons franchise, and Arthur Blank, the owner, deserve a ton of credit.  Blank has made the right decisions at the right time over the last couple of years, and didn&rsquo;t make rash decisions when originally purchasing the team.  His patience is now paying off.

All I can say is that, in the years I have lived here in Atlanta, I have never, ever, seen so many people so enthusiastic about the Falcons.  Last night, we had to go to a second sports bar to find a table, and we were lucky to even get a table at the second bar.  The Falcons franchise, and Arthur Blank, the owner, deserve a ton of credit.  Blank has made the right decisions at the right time over the last couple of years, and didn't make rash decisions when originally purchasing the team.  His patience is now paying off.  For a town that is really a football town, we have at least a couple of years of this level of success to look froward to.  Go Falcons!!\n",

I'm going to talk about these cd's/mp3's/records/albums in no partcular order, so please don't assign value to the order they are written in.  I will be doing a top ten of the year in the next week or two.\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://media-02.epitaph.com/elliott/index.html\">Elliott Smith's From a Basement on the Hill</a>, the record he was working on at the time of his apparent suicide, is more of the same sweet melancholy the Elliot Smith fanbase has come to expect and adore.  It's one of those albums that I can go back and listen to on a regular basis.  He wrote great songs, and this album is no exception.  \n</p>\n<p>\nNeko Case is about to explode.  Of course I don't mean literally, but I have this feeling about her that I've had about other artists in the past who have gone from independent adulation to widespread popularity.  No woman in music today has a more moving, powerful voice than she does, and I honestly don't say that lightly at all.  My iTunes playcount on her newest effort, <a href=\"http://bumps.wpengine.com/?http://media-01.anti.com/neko_case/the_tigers_have_spoken/site/index.html\">The Tigers Have Spoken</a>, seems to average out to about twice a day since I purchased the album, which is an almost unheard of pace for me.  I think, for those of you who aren't the biggest roots, torch and twang,  or country fans in the world, you will find that this album is the most accessible in her current catalog. (New Pornographers excluded there.)  The mix of studio work and live songs on this record seem to flow seamlessly, as do the mixture of covers and originals. Interestingly, this record is from the same label as the Elliot Smith one above, leading me to think that <a href=\"http://www.anti.com/home.php\">Anti</a>, a sub-label of Epitaph, the Bad Religon label, has at least one person with very good taste manning the helm.  Regardless, I am looking forward to Neko's forthcoming full length.\n</p>\n<p>\nLast weekend, I went to see Helmet on their most recent tour.  Well, it's not Helment so much anymore than it is Page Hamilton and a bunch of guys from other acts.  Helmet was good, but that's not the point.  A band from Oakland named <a href=\"http://www.totimoshi.com/\">Totimoshi</a> opened up.  They initially got my attention because the bassist,  Meg Castellanos, is very attractve in a \"I rock out and don't take bs from anyone\" kind of way. (That's just a characterization, I did not actually get a chance to talk to her.)  I know that's a shallow thing, but that's how the story goes.  Anyway, they were phenomenal, great stage presence, great musicianship, and solid songs.  I bought their most recent CD, Monoli, at the show, and ripped it the next day.  They draw from a wide variety of sounds.  The bands that belong in that list, in my opinion, include Nirvana, The Melvins, The Pixies, and Neurosis, in no particular order.  They promised me they would be coming back to Atlanta to play again in the near future, and I am holding them to that promise.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I went to New Orleans a couple of weeks ago, and asked people to give me suggestions, I got a ton from <a href=\"http://www.halfass.com\">Scotty</a>. One of them was \"Check to see if the <a href=\"http://www.morning40.com\">Morning 40 Federation</a> is playing anywhere in town while you are there. I guarantee their shows.\"  He is absolutely right.  I brought a small group of fellow conference goers on Halloween to see them.  They are difficult to describe musically, a party band with bawdy lyrics, a rocking blues band with attitude, a quirky band with odd song topics and lyrics, and perhaps the most fun band I have seen live in the last four years.  I purchased their eponymous CD at the show, and am listening to it at this very moment.  Their fun translates to the CD well, is mixed well, and is worth the purchase.  Regardless of the CD, if you have a chance, go see them, I now am willing to guarantee their shows like Scotty.</p>\n",

This freed up two spots in my reading queue, so I went to the bookstore.\n</p>\n<p>\nNext, I returned home, and am currently munching on Salt and Vinegar chips and sushi while watching football on TV, and my fantasy football league scores on the computer.  \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I should apologize for the mundane nature of this post.

Bare Bones' site does not do a good job of pointing developers looking to use this set of functionality in the right direction.  Once developers have found the documentation in Appendix D of the BBEdit user manual, they will discover that it's not terribly helpful in terms of learning how to map a language to the modules.  As it turns out, and you can read more about the matter in <a href=\"http://mjtsai.com/blog/2004/08/30/bbedit-8/\">this great post on the subject of BBEdit 8</a>, language modules in BBEdit 8 are not quite powerful enough to implement a language module for ColdFusion.  I worked on it for about two hours, a good part of which was just finding the information I needed, then experimenting with how changes to the plist files manifested themselves in my copy of BBEdit with a ColdFusion document open.  Well, perhaps the next version, this one got me much closer than I was before, and I can keep using my Win32 box for ColdFusion coding when I need to do it.</p>\n",

I believe that we actually drank all of the Guiness that they had, to the point where they actually completely ran out of Guiness.  Siebkens is actually a fairly famous bar in the motorcycle and open wheeled racing communities, and the walls, bar and ceiling were covered in stickers for everything related to racing.  (Buzz added a PGA sticker while we were there, I wonder how long it will last?)  If you are ever in that part of Wisconsin, I recommend the place. <p>One of the bartenders, Patrick told all sorts of fun stories about the various famous people, from Paul Newman to Ashley Judd, who had ended up there during the racing weekends.  (Oh, and the other fun bar in Lake Elkhart, Brown Baer, has the best cornbread I have ever tasted.  The cheeseburger may have also been the best I have ever had, but I was too distracted with the slab of cornbread to notice.)</p>\n",

Not only did I have to spend about 8 hours of my time just waiting around that were not necessary, but I then had to pay them for the repair.  It's not that I don't understand that there is some level of variation in the amount of time things like HVAC repairs take, but rather that that variation is within a set of easy to establish parameters.  Given those parameters, it should be pretty easy to give people a one or two hour window, still keep all of your repairmen busy, and not waste too much gas doing so.  All I know is that I would have appreciated the ability to go into work for the full day, which I could have done.  \n</p>\n<p>\nThe sad thing about this, to me, is that Moncrief, the company in question, did great work.  Everyone was polite, answered my questions honestly, and the price I was charged was reasonable.  I don't think I will call them again though, I don't have have enough extra time to wait around that much, this is compounded by the fact that I am a single guy trying to keep up with the responsibilities of a hous eby myself.  Am I wrong to find this sort of thing disrespectful to me and the value of my time?</p>\n",

Here's an example quote from the review.  \"It turns out to be a really brilliant piece of work, and a film that members of all political parties should see without fail.\"\n\n<p>\nThis review is interesting to me, kudos to FoxNews for being unbiased enough to give the film a good review despite all the partisan rhetoric that they are normally accused of spreading.  For the last few weeks, but especially in the last few days, I have heard a litany of people either praising or trashing Michael Moore.  They have had very strong opinions, one person even called him, in a room full of people at a party, a \"piece of shit.\"  Others have said things like, \"I'm proud of him for standing up to the administration.\" The interesting thing about these people, and the difference between them and Fox, is that Roger Friedman actually saw the film before having an opinion about it.  Everyone else seems to have purchased a \"Jump to Conclusions\" mat.\n</p>\n<p>\nI have not seen the film.  I may go see it in the theater, I will probably at least make an attempt to go see it.  For all I know, I might walk out not so happy with Moore.  However, one thing you will not read on bump.net tonight or any night until I see the film will be a review of a movie based on a guess.  \n</p>\nTo me, the troubling thing about this is that it is not an isolated incident in a sea of healthy politics.  Things have gotten downright vitriolic in political discourse in this country right now.  People from both the left and the right seem hellbent on winning this year, and, at times, they seem like they wish to do it at all costs.  The victim of this type of attitude is debate.  Disagreement and discussion are healthy, they allow people to see both sides of an issue, to rethink their position and to come to a stronger, more informed position.  I just don't see this today.  It may be that the people I am surrounded by happen to be a particular type of person, with their minds already made up about November, but I doubt it.  I see the same sorts of things, the kind of burnt turf mentality, on the various Internet discussion forums that I read regularly.  \n\n<p>\nThe times in my life when I have had this \"win at all costs\" approach to an argument or issue, I may have won the argument more times than not.  In every single one of these cases, without exception, I have paid the price for that approach.  I could enumerate these mistakes here, but there is no point in exposing a litany of personal failures to make my point.  We need to get to a healthier discourse.  I would be interested in hearing others opinions about this, be they from the left, right, or moderates like myself.</p>\n",

Of course, since it hasn't been released yet, I couldn't possibly have a copy of it yet:-)  Jason Zada also seems to have <a href=\"http://www.jasonzada.com/previous/003190.php\">an opinion and stuff</a>.  Before writing anything about the cd, I listened to it five times, and I didn't get tired of it. \n\n<p>\nIt's a hip hop record.  No instrumental goodness, no punk goodness, straight up, almost minimalistic, hip hop.  The beats are mostly from the same school as Hello Nasty, the chop it up into loops and loop that sh*t up over and over, then throw some scratches on top of that, school.  In some ways, after listening to the record the first time, I was thinking that I couldn't wait for the inevitable remixes to start dropping.  Structurally, the vocal content would leave a remixer with a lot to work with.  Overall, they didn't try to do too much with the beats, and it works just fine from where I stand. For those of you looking for the fourth major beat re-invention of the Beastie Boys, this is not that record.  It is in some ways a couplet to <i>Hello Nasty</i> the way that <i>Ill Communication</i> was a couplet to <i>Check Your Head</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs far as lyrics and rhyming goes, this record is different, very different, from what came before in a few ways.  Although not as pervasive as I had feared, politics have crept into the lyrical content, and it gets especially bad in a couple of instances.  I mean, to state the obvious, it is your record, and if that is what you want to talk about, be my guest.  I, however, cringed a bit the first time I heard \"It Takes Time to Build.\"   There are some of the cultural references that we have come to rely on the Beastie Boys to provide, but the number is nowhere near what I had come to expect in the past.  Stylistically, as hinted at by the first single, they branch out a bit more than they did on Hello Nasty.  For instance, \"Crawlspace\"  has Adrock laying down some different stuff.   This I enjoyed quite a bit.  One track that really stood out was \"Rhyme the Rhyme Well\" from both a beats and vocal standpoint.\n</p>\n<p>\nOverall, I like this record quite a bit.  I get the feeling, as with most of the Beasties work, that after another twenty-five listens, I will very attached to this record.  It seems more subtle and minimalistic in some ways than the rest of their body of work, and while this might not bowl you over in the first couple of listens, it will undoubtedly insidiously creep into your consciousness and win you over.</p>\n",

I could find no reference at all to a cluster bomb by this name.  I sent an email off to the reporter who did the interview last night but haven&rsquo;t heard back yet.

I currently use the keyboard commands in <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> to do this same thing and more(displays album artwork at the beginning of a new song, and provides play etc controls).  It got me to thinking that it might be useful to list the ones that I use here for other folks to check out.  \n</p>\n<p>\nSo those are the first two from left to right.  The third one is <a href=\"http://www.reelintelligence.com/BluePhoneMenu/\">BluePhoneMenu</a>.  It adds a menu with Signal and Battery strength for your Bluetooth enabled and supported phone (I have the Sony Ericcson T61x.)  It also does on screen call notification, which is quite handy if you are a headphone wearing fool like myself.\n</p>\n<p>\nFourth from the left is the ubiquitous <a href=\"http://blacktree.com/apps/quicksilver/\">Quicksilver</a>.  I'll save everyone yet another description of this invaluable utility.  Next to it is <a href=\"http://www.orange-carb.org/SBM/faq.html\">SlimBatteryMonitor</a> which saves me some screen real estate on the menu bar for more utilities without taking away the functionality of the Apple battery monitor.\n</p>\n<p>\nNext to that is the excellent, donationware, <a href=\"http://www.objectpark.net/mc.html\">Menu Calendar</a>.  It gives me the current date without any hassles, access to a monthly calendar, and easy access to iCal. The rest are all Apple provided ones, Airport, Displays, Applescript, Security, Bluetooth, and  Sound.  \n</p>\n<p>\nGot any that you can't live without that I missed?

He also explains that they were totally aware of the News reader explosion(RSS/Atom) when they decided to go down this road.  He also sent me a link to <a href=\"http://www.kinja.com/user/nick\">his digest</a>, which is subscribed to over 600 sites.  I maintain that this won't be a good tool for following that many sites unless one is able to keep refreshing and checking that page.  On the other hand, for the audience that would be interested in following fewer sites, this seems like it could be a good graphical tool without having to search for the rss feed, which is on a different part of seemingly every blog that doesn't have automagical discovery enabled.  Another feature that could end up making it a lot more useful would be the ability to create multiple digests under a single account.  Then one could create small subject specific blogs for each area that one follows.  Still, I am obviously not the target user for a system like this.  I wonder however, if my mother is, or my less technical siblings.</p>\n",

The relapse was a moment of mental weakness involving alcohol, and I&rsquo;ve decided that, instead of avoiding social drinking situations as I did when I quit that time, I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and put myself in those situations throughout the quitting process because I think that will help me to develop the mental hardness necessary to stay quit months from now.

It really is pretty amazing what Danger Mouse managed to create.\n\n<p>\nNow, having said that, there is a point I would love to make about this.  This work cannot be released through normal music distribution channels.  The samples would never be cleared, or the sheer cost of licensing them would make it impossible to released.  Danger Mouse has taken two pieces of art, and combined them into a new beautifully crafted piece of art which stands out in it's own right.  Increasingly, I have been seeking out these types of musical quiltworks.  People like <a href=\"http://www.djztrip.com/\">Z-Trip</a> and <a href=\"http://www.resetmusic.com/\">Reset</a> are creating phenomenal pieces of work that is purely derived from source material they could never get clearance for through legal channels.  I am forced to wonder how many of these pieces of art that our current music sampling and copyright laws are costing us.  There is a capitalistic governor on artistic creations of this kind.  It's truly a shame.  It is a stark example of what <a href=\"http://www.lessig.org/\">Mr. Lessig</a> has been railing and fighting against for years, and it makes me realize just how important the ability to create derivative works can be.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "Andy's <a href=\"http://www.waxy.org/archive/2004/01/14/research.shtml\">Researching the 2004 Oscar Screeners</a> shows just how far video sharing has come.  This must be some truly scary shit for the movie folks.  Now, let's see if they have put the extra time they've had since the Napster explosion, and the lessons learned from the music folks, to good use in working through the problem.  I mean, really, they need to look at their content distribution system very carefully here.\n\n<p>\nThe one really huge difference here is that movies, far more than music, draw a premium price during their initial run.  Meaning, you can go to a theater and see a movie, but you can't take it home until several months later.  This definitely works against the movie folks when it comes to sharing.  This time period where they create this \"artificial\" scarcity is also the time period where pirates are most likely to want the film.  Obviously, the theater experience is supposed to be a premium viewing experience from a screen and sound perspective, but this is being eroded as time goes on and home theater gets better and cheaper. Theater owners who have been overcharging us for everything from tickets to popcorn may find themselves the first set of business victims of this new content sharing battle. After a film''s theatrical run, there is a long gap until it is commercially released as a for-sale product.  The scarcity during this time period is even worse than the scarcity during the theater run, thus, sharing will continue during this part of the movie's lifecycle.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo really, the movie business has two issues where the music business had one.  During the initial theatrical run and the ensuing time period until the commercial release of the movie on DVD, there is no legal way to take a film home, and so, sharing during this time period of a movie's life will still be an issue even once their equivalent of the iTune Music Store is launched.  Of course the second problem is some sort of electronic distribution like the iTMS, and I have seen several companies working on this problem already.  In all cases, they are going about things the way that pre-iTunes Music Store online music ventures were done, with Draconian DRM, limited access time, and no ability to burn to DVD or CD.  I predict that these ventures will be equally unsuccessful as the early online music distribution was, and that they will have to come around a bit, despite the lessons learned in the music sharing battles, which, of course, continue even now with legitimate online music distribution only making partial inroads.  They should cut out the middle man, and begin rethinking the way the distribute movies now, or the next few years will be even more painful for them than the last few have been for the music companies.  It definitely looks like the hardware companies are <a href=\"http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/more_from_ces_endless_personal_video_players.php\">well on their way</a> to creating a device demand for this content.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "So, I have been using Dave's <a href=\"http://feeds.scripting.com/\">Share Your OPML</a> site for about a week now, and I have to say that the idea is a great one.  I have already discovered a bunch of feeds that I never knew existed by browsing the lists of subscriptions of people whom I respect or otherwise have some level of context for from the Web.\n\n<p>\nHaving said that, there are a few things about the site that make it far less useful to me than it would otherwise be.  First, it catalogs feeds by their URL, not by the URL of the parent site, at least as far as I can tell.  As a result, it tells me that I am not subscribed to feeds that I actually am subscribed to, just not that particular version of the feed.  This becomes more troubling as sites get three or four different feeds for different RSS formats.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe second issue is one easily fixed.  When looking at people's subscription lists, the name of the feed/site links to the feed, as it should.  However, there is no link in the listing to the actual site.  I want this because I don't want to mess up my subs lists with sites that I won't want to have in my list.  The ability to get to the site in one click makes it far easier for me to tell if I really do want to give a particular feed a try.\n</p>\n<p>\nI guess the moral of the story with both of these issues is that RSS feeds are a part of a particular Web site.  This application fails to close that loop, and treats the feeds just as feeds, as if there weren't greater context to the posts and information than just a feed.  With a couple of adjustments, that feed to Web loop could be closed, and things would make a lot more sense.(to me)\n</p>\n<p>\nUpdate:  I just noticed that the <a href=\"http://feeds.scripting.com/rankings\">Top 100 feeds list</a> does link to each individual site rather than the rss file for the site, so, clearly, this is something that Dave could do, perhaps with an icon in each line item, in people's subscriptions lists.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "I'm working from home today in order to take delivery of some new bedroom furniture.  Woot woot!!  It's been a long time in coming, but I think I have finally gotten into a \"nesting\" groove with my house.  Like so many other things in my life, I tend to look too much at the big picture, get overwhelmed, and get frustrated.  This tends to get worse with the house because it is a large place for one person, and the big yard and pool only make that worse.  This year, I have resolved to focus on one room, or one outdoor project, at a time.  I decided to start with the bedroom because it ends up being where I spend the bulk of my time.  As a result, the guest bedroom also gets an upgrade.\n\n<p>\nIt's worth mentioning that this was all set in motion by one of the best customer service experiences of my life.  Last summer, in July, I decided to look into getting new bedroom furniture.  I went to a few stores, and decided that I liked one particular set, but that the amount of money was beyond what I wanted to spend at that point.  I hadn't been back, or even really thought about going back, until I got a call from the saleswoman who talked to me in July last week.  That's right, six months after I was in the store, she called me to let me know that they were changing around their showroom, and that the king bed I was looking at would not fit in the new location, so they were replacing it with a Queen size and needed to sell the King at a deep discount immediately.  I went in over the weekend, and walked out with almost a fifty percent discount on the entire set of furniture I wanted.  Rest assured, when it is time for the new dining room table, I know what store and salesperson I will be going to first.  It's this kind of personal customer service that I find missing in most of my consumer type experiences these days.  She even called me this morning, not because she had to, but because she wanted to make sure that my delivery experience went as smoothly as possible.  So thanks Kelly, I really appreciate it.  In case you live in Atlanta, and are looking for furniture, Kelly works at the <a href=\"http://www.storehouse.com/\">Storehouse</a> in Lenox Mall.</p>\n",

I have had an account with them for six years.  In the switchover, they lost all of the billing settings that I had set up with them, but never mentioned that this would be the case.  A month ago, I got a call from them saying that my account was overdue.  I immediately paid the balance, but was confused as to why they didn't automatically bill me, like they had been doing for six years.  I was informed that I had to log into their customer service Web site to set this up, and that they could not do the set up(re-setup from my perspective) over the phone.  So I went to the site, and attempted to log into the system with the username and password I had been using all along.  No dice.  I was informed that I had to re-register for the customer service Web site.  What?  I have had an account for six years, you have all of my information.  So I attempted to re-register.  I was then informed that an account for my phone number already existed.  Well, duh, I've had an account for six years.  I was then informed that I should call a customer service number if I received this message.  Ok, I'll call customer service and clear this up.  I called and navigated through their voice activated menu system to the correct option.  \"We're sorry, we cannot answer your call right now.  Please call us back at a later time.\"  \n</p>\n<p>\nWhat?  Oh, I wonder why the number could possibly be so busy?  I am currently printing a number portability checklist.  Goodbye AT &amp; T, and thanks for nothing.</p>\n",

In my opinion, we learn more about ourselves in times of difficulty than we do in the \"salad days\" of our lives.  While I may not have been happy about some things that have happened to me in the last 12 months, they've really given me the chance to gain a little more wisdom about who I really am as a person, and I am very thankful for that opportunity.

We're targets because we represent 95 percent of the computing population. Attackers aren't going to attack Mac OS X users for an obvious reason: The OS has only a few users. If we all jumped ship to Linux, for example, that platform would then come under attack.\"\n\n<p>\nI keep hearing this argument from people, that Windows has more exploits <strong>only</strong> because it is more widely used.  I have to take issue with this gentleman's statement, and those of a similar nature.  I understand the context he is coming from, that he has built his career around reporting on Microsoft, so he is subjective, but I believe he does his readers a disservice with this particular set of statements.  Of course one of the reasons why there are more exploits for Windows is that it has marketshare.  Where I take issue, however, is with his implication that Windows is just as secure an operating system as Mac OS X or Linux.  It simply is not as secure.  Linux has a large amount of the Web server market, yet I haven't heard of a worm bringing down thousands of Linux machines across the Internet.  This isn't to say that Linux is without exploitable security flaws at all, I've had machines that were attacked or exploited.  In virtually every instance, it was my fault for not patching something.   Microsoft is more concerned with getting product out the door than they are in getting things right on the security front.  This has made each of us who use a Microsoft OS beta-testers.  The second and more relevant reason why there are more exploits for Windows XP than Linux or Mac OS X is that Microsoft has provided people who wish to develop exploits with a lot of facilities for creating them, so it is far easier for someone to create an exploit.  I would like to see some of these very biased Windows journalists admit this fact for a change, it's as annoying to me as partisan politics in this country, throwing practicality and fact to the wind in order to advance a very biased viewpoint linked to a career path.\n</p>\n<p>\nHere's <a href=\"http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/25/1959204&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=106&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=172&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=95\">a Slashdot thread</a> with some interesting information on this subject.</p>\n",

I could tell, even from the reactions of the people who work in the hospitality industry down there, that most people seem to view people who are on vacation alone like they are some kind of freaks.\n\n<p>\nWell, Miami is a beautiful city, the weather was gorgeous for the most part, despite forecasts which said otherwise, and the people were friendly and fun.  For the first couple of days, I chose to keep to myself, lying by the pool and reading books, so many books in fact, that I had to run to a nearby bookstore during my lunch wandering the second day to pick up some more material to keep me busy.  I will leave the book notes for another entry in the next few days.  As the trip progressed, I met some awesome and interesting people who I spent a bunch of time with.  I firmly believe that things happen for a reason, and I return with a reinforcement of that opinion.  I return refreshed, happier, and far less stressed out than when I left.  I wish I could have been gone more than five days, but, fear not, I'm heading up North for some quality time with my family, which is long overdue, this weekend for a couple of days.  In the meantime, there seem to be a sheer multitude of work things that need my attention.  I guess I should make a couple of notes about places I went to in Miami that I would recommend, since I took pretty copious notes and a bunch of pictures while I was there, but that will have to wait for now.</p>\n",

The new features all make sense strategically, and put them solidly ahead of MSFT in the OS innovation department yet again.  MSFT has attempted to create buzz for Longhorn, something that won&rsquo;t see the light of day for another two years at least.  I can only imagine all the innovations we&rsquo;ll see from our friends in Cupertino in the same time period.  Second, I&rsquo;m drooling over the new hardware architecture.  It puts Apple in a place where they can plausibly compete with the Wintel architecture, even if they are only slightly behind in performance, the OS is so much better that it makes for a good argument.  By the time the machines hit the streets, the top end Wintel machine will be faster than the one we saw today.

There is a part of me that got burned with the first generation TiBook, its crappy slot loading drive, low video memory, and lack of an internal cd burner, that wants me to wait for the second generation 17 inch before making a purchase.

My area(s) of the project included a variety of tasks, but the single largest one was building a real time golf scoring system that integrated with a few different XML golf scoring feeds on the back end, and with our content management system for output.   Since some of our vendors for scoring had never used XML before, I had the opportunity to actually author my own XML format for golf scoring.  I&rsquo;ve learned a lot along the way about the challenges of using XML for something like this.  The vendors that had their own xml formats, by and large, didn&rsquo;t understand the value of maintaining the semantic nature of the information they were marking up.  They were obviously used to output markup, like html, and so combined unlike information into elements, did not name like information attributes consistently,  and generally did not implement XML in a manner that made lot of sense.  This meant that I had to do some gymnastics to get the information out of the XML in a raw form.  One thing I can tell you is that ColdFusion MX might just be the best platform to use for doing XML development available right now.  My development time was considerably lower than some of the open source XML software that I have worked with in the past, and I had little trouble adding additional vendors once I had built the initial framework.  ColdFusion Components make it much easier to swap out the data layer of an application without having to rewrite everything that sits on top of the data layer.  I guess I will post more about this in the coming weeks, we&rsquo;ve got a lot of other work that we want to do, and some great ideas for future features and development.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

My development time was considerably lower than some of the open source XML software that I have worked with in the past, and I had little trouble adding additional vendors once I had built the initial framework.  ColdFusion Components make it much easier to swap out the data layer of an application without having to rewrite everything that sits on top of the data layer.  I guess I will post more about this in the coming weeks, we've got a lot of other work that we want to do, and some great ideas for future features and development.  \n\n<p>\nThe other thing I will comment on now is that this might be the most skilled, top to bottom, team of designers, client side coders, back end developers, content managers, system admins, and project managers that I have worked with to date.  Everyone was a real pleasure to work with, and the environment here at CNN Center is a great place to work.  This is a good thing considering how many hours I have spent here in the office over the last 24 days.  It was certainly made more interesting by the current war situation in Iraq.  CNN goes into hyper-mode during these times, and it's been interesting to see. We also get a bunch of the raw live feeds here in the office that let us get a glimpse behind the broadcast scenes both in the studio here, and out in the field.  This week it is all about The Masters though, and I have to get back to my server and feed watching, more later.</p>\n",

Generally, I tend to be more socially liberal, and more fiscally conservative.  From Republicans, especially the tow the party line sort that I tend to be exposed to these days, I tend to get a liberal label, and they seem to use this label in a very mean spirited manner, although I think I&rsquo;m much closer to centrist Republicans than I am to most Democrats.  I tend to differ from Democrats in terms of practical matters, at least in my viewpoint.  I find some of their stands to be just silly.  I&rsquo;ve been studying up a little on possible candidates in 2004 from the Democrats, especially since <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dori and Tom<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have been covering it once in a while.  This has led me to believe that the person who has announced for 2004 that is the most similar to my viewpoints thus far is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Howard Dean<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

From Republicans, especially the tow the party line sort that I tend to be exposed to these days, I tend to get a liberal label, and they seem to use this label in a very mean spirited manner, although I think I'm much closer to centrist Republicans than I am to most Democrats.  I tend to differ from Democrats in terms of practical matters, at least in my viewpoint.  I find some of their stands to be just silly.  I've been studying up a little on possible candidates in 2004 from the Democrats, especially since <a href=\"http://www.backupbrain.com\">Dori and Tom</a> have been covering it once in a while.  This has led me to believe that the person who has announced for 2004 that is the most similar to my viewpoints thus far is <a href=\"http://www.deanforamerica.com/issues.htm\">Howard Dean</a>.

				"content_text": "Console games, especially those for the PS2, have taken a sort of weird turn in the last year.  It's becoming more and more common for the more popular games to try and sell more merchandise than just that particular game.  Two recent examples from my gaming library include <a href=\"http://www.rockstargames.com/vicecity/\">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ea.com/easports/platforms/games/madden2003/playstation2.jsp\">Madden NFL 2003</a>.  In order to get to additional cheat codes for Vice City, one can purchase one of the six soundtrack cd's that go along with the game or the boxed set of all six cd's.  In order to get to some of the cheat cards in Madden, one must own other EA Sports games.

When I was at Macromedia Devcon 2002, I talked at length to Phil Costa, the Product Manager for ColdFusion, and to the Apple folks that were at the show about this particular subject.  Apple said that they wanted Macromedia to support their platform with their server technologies and that was one of the reasons that they were at Devcon in the first place.  So, when they finally get this, they refuse comment?</p>\n",

I doubt very much that I would have come through my situations as well without her music.  Her band sounded tight and she has some really talented musicians playing with her.  My brother is also friends with Aimee's guitar player and producer, Michael Lockwood.  After the show, we got to hang out a bit before they hit the road for tonight's date in North Carolina.  He's a really nice guy, down to Earth, and also a Mac and technology savvy person.  If you have a chance to see her, I assure you that you won't be dissapointed one bit.\n",

The restructure of iTools into the fee based .Mac service and the full price charge for the new version of the Operating System (Jaguar) have some people up in arms.  I don&rsquo;t doubt that the reality of the situation is that Apple knew that these moves would not please a good chunk of folks.  I think the reality here is just that times are not so great in the PC sector, and that companies need to squeeze out revenue wherever possible.  Apple looks at possible revenue streams that do not include the purchase of hardware, and these two are pretty obvious choices.  I think if they started charging for the iApps, they would have defeated the purpose of having those apps to begin with, and probably made people even more angry than they are now.  Servers for something like iTools aren&rsquo;t cheap, and even though it really is not Apple&rsquo;s core business to be in a business like this, the opportunity was there.  Most of their forays into territory like this (remember eWorld?) have ended in failure, so I would say &ldquo;stay tuned&rdquo;.   I think people should recognize that, in the climate that they are in, Apple needs to do whatever they can to sustain/create revenue, and this includes charging for something they probably wanted to keep free.  Personally, I could care less about a mac.com email address, but I&rsquo;m not the Mac-bigot that I once was.  I&rsquo;m mostly using Windows XP these days, and NT at the office for software reasons.

Most of their forays into territory like this (remember eWorld?) have ended in failure, so I would say \"stay tuned\".   I think people should recognize that, in the climate that they are in, Apple needs to do whatever they can to sustain/create revenue, and this includes charging for something they probably wanted to keep free.  Personally, I could care less about a mac.com email address, but I'm not the Mac-bigot that I once was.  I'm mostly using Windows XP these days, and NT at the office for software reasons.  Mac OS X is brilliant, I love it, and I wish that I could use it at the office, but it's not sooo much better than Windows XP.  Well, just some thoughts I wanted to post last week but couldn't.\n",

I would call it the \"American\" OK Computer, but it is harsher to the taste than OK Computer, which makes perfect sense if you think about it and are familiar with the Lips.  If you know me, you would know that I would not compare anything to OK Computer lightly, it is one of my favorite records of all time.   I would also go so far as to say that this is the best new album I've heard so far this year.  What is odd to me is that I've never really been a Flaming Lips fan before I heard this cd, although I will certainly be delving into their back catalog now.  I went to <a href=\"http://www.criminal.com\">Criminal Records</a> (check out the domain cred there), my favorite music store here in the ATL, and Liam and other staff members told me to check it out.  I ignored them, but two days later I heard them talking to someone else who was raving about the record.  I finally broke down and listened to it, and bought it on the spot.  It's a very layered cd, with plenty of of ear candy through my headphones, but it still maintains some sort of an organic vibe despite the presence of the layers of electronics.\n",

Having said that, Apple doesn&rsquo;t have the history of taking advantage of undocumented system features with their apps like Microsoft has with Office.

These built in applications, iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and the online application suite iTools, tend to be best of breed applications.  They make the platform more attractive to consumers, without a doubt.  I think that the long term gain of market share by delivering applications like these to Apple customers outwieghs the negatives.  I do wonder, however, where the line should be drawn.

				"content_text": "\n<p>\nSo what's left with X?  I mean I now have every app I need on Mac OS X with the release of Photoshop 7 and the ability to synch my Clie.  I got rid of Classic on this machine a few months ago, and now I don't feel like I'm lacking any application that I need to get work done. (Which kind of stinks because I'm out of excuses now.)  I'm quite happy with Microsoft Office, OmniOutliner, Photoshop 7, Flash MX, BBEdit, and all the other Mac OS X apps I'm using. Vendors that have still not made it to Mac OS X with apps that I used to use on either a regular or sporadic basis have probably lost me as a customer because I have either found a replacement that I like on X or have learned to do without their application altogether.  \n</p>\n<p>\nSome fine examples of this are Fireworks and Dreamweaver.  in my opinion, Macromedia dropped the ball on these in a serious way.  The reason I think this is that there are other applications that do similar or the same things that made it there first and the demand for native apps was fierce.  I used Fireworks almost every day before I switched to X.  I've now learned to use Photoshop for the few things that I didn't know how to use it for previously so I don't need Fireworks at all anymore.  I never really used Dreamweaver that much to begin with, but had it been available before, I would have bought it.  Considering that Mac database connectivity in UltraDev has always been a second class cousin of its Windows friends(Cold Fusion Studio for instance.) I doubt that there will be a compelling reason to purchase Dreamweaver.  I think there was an error in strategy there.  Unless Macromedia is going to come to market with some innovative, compelling, must have features, I don't see any reason to upgrade my Mac OS 9 licenses to Mac OS X.  That's only one example, but one that I think is pretty obvious.  In another, the combination of OmniOutliner and OmniGraffle has replaced Inspiration, which I used to swear by for site mapping and visual documentation of technical solutions.  If you don't make it over the hump, you are bound to lose customers.  This is going to get more bloody for software vendors in the next few months.  I care more about getting work done than I love your applications.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe interface of the operating system still has a few quirks that irk me.  More specifically, I find the Finder to be slower than it should be, it has some behaviors that are far from intuitive, and some things that I wish were there that  are not.  I really am annoyed by the list view's window behavior, which is missing some of the basic features of the classic finder.  There are some new features, however, that I now just love.  One example of this is the column view.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe bottom line is that I am pretty happy with Mac OS X, which is somewhat surprising to me based on it's age and maturity level.\n</p>\n",

They replaced so many of their core players, and these guys were the ones who set the tone in the clubhouse.  Players aren't just interchangable parts that you can easily swap in and out.  It could be worse, of course, look at the situation in Texas.  I'd hate to be a fly on the wall in the Ranger's clubhouse these days.

I seem to switch back and forth between hanging out in the living room, and hanging out in the office.  Having a wireless network that actually works anywhere in the house, including my screened in porch and by my pool in the backyard, is going to get much cooler when the weather gets nicer.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnyway, I'm going to Austin a bit early, bringing my skates, and I'm hoping to get to see a little more of Austin than I did the last time I went to SXSW two years ago.  The other thing that is happening today is that I am finally going to deal with the mess of hair on my head.  Had a bad haircut a year ago, and I have spent the entire time since trying to grow it out.   As a result, my hair is halfway down my back, and it's getting really tiring.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nIt's funny how much a difference a couple of months can make.  I have used the Mac OS in some form or another since 1987.  I was there for the transition to color monitors, the addition of the CD-ROM drive, eWorld, the transition to PowerPC (painful at times, remember 7.5.2?), the clones, their death and so on.  As I've noted here before, when 10.1 and Microsoft Office V.X were released this fall, I went to Mac OS X full time.\n</p>\n<p>\nI rarely boot the Classic environment, only when I need Photoshop and Fireworks, and aside from that, never.  I've had to eat some nails along the way, but I've adapted and embraced Mac OS X.  It's not perfect, but I do like it.  There are things there that I've wanted for a long time, like a command line interface(can you believe that I was missing DOS when I wasn't on a Windows machine?), and it just doesn't crash.  Others have had different experiences there, but for me it's been rock solid as both a desktop and server OS so far.(I have just jinxed myself.)\n</p>\n<p>\nToday, I went over a friends house to configure her brand new iMac.  Not the cool new Luxor iMac, but one of the older Snow ones.  She needs to use Quark and a couple of other apps that aren't available for Mac OS X yet, so she'll be running Mac OS 9 for the time being.  I booted the machine, and began installing updates.  All I could think of the entire time was how old fashioned the operating system seemed to me now.  I've learned how to use Mac OS X, and the operating system that was like an old friend a couple of months ago now seems like a distant relative I only see once a year.  It was almost shocking.  I still know how to do everything, but it all seemed foreign.  It's for this reason that I know that Apple is on the right road with their operating system.  Oh, there's resistance from some people, but people are always scared of change.  We're quite close to having Flash and Photoshop over here, and that's the tipping point.  Unaddressed issues with things like fonts will get dealt with then, of that I'm quite certain.  So goodbye old friend, we had a great fourteen years together.</p>\n",

This is an astonishingly higher accuracy rate than most people who give me advice.   In that spirit, Magic Eightball Everywhere:\n</p>\n<p>\nHere's an online <a href=\"http://www.creamy.org/eightball/\">magic eightball</a>.  It's a Web app.  You can also see what other people are asking, although I found that this feature was not for the faint of heart and could be downright depressing.   People ask all sorts of sappy questions like; \"Does she ever think of me now?\"  It just breaks my little heart.\n</p>\n<p>\nMore impressive is <a href=\"http://8ball.federated.com/\">The Public Eightball</a>.  It's an actual Magic Eightball that is hooked to a Lego Mindstorm-based apparatus that shakes the ball for you and displays the result in a Webcam image.  Unfortunately, it seems to currently be off kilter, and you can't see the result.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you don't find either of these to your liking, Yahoo actually has <a href=\"http://dir.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Humor/Advice/Web_Oracles/Eight_Ball/\">a portal category</a> devoted to just online Magic Eightball Apps.  A more thorough listing, with reviews, is <a href=\"http://ofb.net/8ball/lame.html\">here</a>.  The same site has <a href=\"http://ofb.net/8ball/answers.html\">a listing</a> of the actual Eightball answers.  You can find a scientific dissection of an Eightball <a href=\"http://fiendation.com/people/chris/eight.htm\">here</a>.\n</p><p>\nIf you are running Mac OS X, <a href=\"http://www.inferiis.com/eightball.html\">this dockling</a> will allow you to have a Magic Eightball in your dock.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are running Windows, <a href=\"http://www.fullspectrum.com/deeth/deethware/#LB\">this app</a> will let you have a Magic Eightball in your system tray.\n</p>\n<p>\nI'm ashamed to admit it, but I could not find a standalone Java app or a Linux app that simulates the Magic Eightball.  If you know of one, please email me so that I can add it to this post.  I'm certain that they are out there somewhere.\n</p><p>\n<a href=\"http://www.yesterdayland.com/popopedia/shows/toys/ty1039.php\">This site</a> seems to have the best little history of the Eightball that I could find, but it's not very in-depth.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"http://bumps.wpengine.com/resized_ipod.jpg\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" width=\"75\" height=\"100\"> I've had my <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipod/\">iPod</a> for almost a week now, and here's a few observations about it.  First, it's small, just slightly bigger than the rio 600 that I use when I go to the gym.  The size difference when compared to the <a href=\"http://www.archos.com/us/products_jukebox.html\">Archos Jukebox</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.nomadworld.com/products/Jukebox_20GB/\">Nomad Jukebox</a> makes a huge difference when I use it in my car, or when traveling.  It's not noticeably heavy either.   While I wish that it came with some sort of case, it fits without issue in my <a href=\"http://store.yahoo.com/goincase/mdmp3musicbelt.html\">Incase MD/MP3 Music Belt</a> which also has a pocket for the earbud style headphones it shipped with. (I highly recommend Incase's product line, as I use their bags for my laptops as well.)\n\n<p>\nAs far as design and interface goes, this is, without a doubt, the best MP3 product I have used to date.  The integrated scroll wheel makes it quite easy to navigate through the large amount of music that the device holds, and the simplicity of having only five buttons and a hold switch made learning to use the device a snap.  The only thing really lacking from the device management interface is the ability to construct playlists on the fly.  You are expected to do this using the iTunes 2 application that manages the music stored on the device.   The use of the Chicago font has made the interface really easy to read, and the \"now playing\" information screen scrolls to allow you to see beyond the limits of the screen size when song or artist names are very long.  No such option exists in the song list view, and I wish that they had done something to allow you to see the full title of the highlighted song scroll.  The backlight is bright and makes the screen very readable in low light conditions.  In comparison to the Nomad Jukebox, and the RioVolt, two other devices I have owned which need to navigate through similar amounts of music and settings, the iPod is much more readable and usable. The back of the device is a chromed stainless steel that is so shiny that it can be used as a shaving mirror.  The downside to that is that it smudges really easily.  The front of the device is incased in a quarter inch thick plexiglass shield that protects the LCD screen.  Again, this will scratch really easily, which will lead to my being more protective of the device than most of my portable audio devices.  The top of the device, which contains the Firewire port, headphone jack, and hold switch is easily accessible, and the device will stand vertically.  I do wonder why they didn't include a cover or bumper for the exposed Firewire port.  It seems that someone who is careless with their iPod could unintentionally damage this very important connector.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe device charges when attached to the computer via the same firewire connection it uses to synch the mp3 files.  Additionally, the device comes with a dedicated charger that plugs into an electrical socket for charging without a computer.  I haven't used the device for longer than two hours thus far, but the battery still showed a full charge after the two hour listening session.  Charging seems very rapid via the firewire connection, but I have not, as yet, doen any tests to see just how long it takes to charge an empty or close to empty battery.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe iPod comes with no user manual, but a quick start guide is provided.  The iPod help file, which installs with iTunes 2, is pretty comprehensive.  Again, the device is so straightforward that the only thing I have actually had to look up was the location of the iPod options within iTunes 2.  The CD included contains only the installers for the Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X versions of iTunes 2.  I was surprised by this because Apple ships all of their machines with a bunch of MP3's pre-installed now.  In addition, the device had no MP3's on it out of the box.  They missed an opportunity to push some stuff on us there, which is not something I would expect from Apple.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe earbud heaphones that ship with the device are very nice, and they sound great.  They are slightly larger than most earbud style headphones I have used previously.  They are comfortable in my ears, so much so that I managed to fall asleep on a plane yesterday with them in my ears.  I would imagine that the level of comfort with them will vary with the size and shape of an individual's ears, and people with smaller ears may find them a bit large.  They ship with a straight \"stem\" rather than the L-shaped most audio devices ship with now, and this makes fitting the device into either a vertical or horizontal case with the headphones plugged in more difficult.   The device, in general, sounds very good, as I would expect it to.  I don't feel that there is a large difference between any of the devices I have used in terms of sound quality.  The iPod doesn't have controls that allow you to adjust the bass and treble of music you are listening to while you are listening to it.  Again, this is something that you are expected to do with the iTunes application.  This is one case where I really think it would be helpful to have the feature built into the device.  It's quite difficult to judge how things are going to sound through headphones without going through them using the headphones on the computer first.\n</p>\n<p>\nSetting the device up with my computer, a first generation Powerbook G4/500 running MacOS X 10.1.1, took only a few minutes.  I had already installed iTunes 2 when it was released by Apple the previous week, and no additional software was required.  Upon attaching the Firewire cable to the iPod, iTunes launched and asked me what name I wanted to assign to the device automatically.  The initial synch of my music, which at that point was only about 300 songs, took about three minutes.  In comparison, my initial synch of my Nomad Jukebox took well over an hour.  The difference makes the addition of new music to the device much less of an ordeal.  Since the initial synch, I have ripped and added about 300 additional songs to the device, with the synching part of the process being neglible in comparison to the time it takes to rip from the CD's.  Aside from the interface and size, this is, to me, the hugest selling point of this device.  While listening to music, the device buffers a large chunk of music to it's RAM, so that it is unusual to feel the hard drive spinning.  Another huge upside to this is that there is not a huge pause in between songs like the other hard drive based players I have used.  iTunes allows the user to either synch their entire library, specific playlists within their library, or manually manage the transfer of files without iTunes doing the transfers automatically.  I find iTunes 2 to be clean sounding and easy to use as a desktop player, and the integration with the device is flawless.\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, a quick tweak of the iPod settings in iTunes (accessed by clicking on the iPod options button) allows you to mount the device as an external hard drive.  This does not give you access to the music on the device, probably to keep the RIAA happy, but there are already hacks out there that allow the user to see and transfer the music. (See the free file access link below for one.)  I have not, as of yet, used the hard drive feature beyond just mounting it and testing a file transfer, but I can imagine that it will come in handy in the future, and makes the device that much more flexible and useful.  Personally, I think Apple has differentiated this device from its competition enough to justify the price.  If you have questions about the above, or are curious about something I failed to mention, please feel free to <a href=\"mailto:robert@bump.net\">email me</a>, and I will update this posting with additional details in response to your questions.</p>\n",

I'm hoping to have time to post it tonight.  I'm quite tired, at the end of an 8 month project.  Quite literally the end.\n",

I hear people making all sorts of statements about what we are doing, how it is wrong, how we should be doing this or that instead.  I hate to say this, but I find that it's mostly people in the pacifist camp making these sort of statements.  We haven't done anything visible yet, which I think is very telling.  I give this administration, which I disagree with on almost every domestic issue, all the credit in the world in this situation.  Are you mad because they haven't released their proof about who is involved/culpable in the act?

Even on the page that the article appears on, I didn't acknowledge the ad in the middle of the article until I went back and looked for it.

You can't go back without starting over from scratch.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo I installed.  At first, everything seemed normal, then I noticed that my sound card, which is the newest component in my machine, wasn't working.  After some surfing and a couple of emails, it was clear that the card wasn't going to work for at least a month.  Then, suddenly, the ethernet card, the second newest component, stopped working altogether.  Haven't been able to figure that one out yet. So that hampers my use of the machine a little.   Then blue screen of death, blue screen of death, blue screen of death.  Then constant rebooting without my interference.  So now I'm debating whether I should make the huge migration back to Windows 2000 or wait for RC2 and the component vendors to release drivers and see if I can salvage things from where they are.  It's a good thing that this machine is more of a test bed for me than a machine I actually do work on.(I was saying the same thing late last year when I installed the Mac OS X beta.)  Developing a working operating system is not an easy task.</p>\n",

It doesn&rsquo;t really seem like it has been revamped in a long while.  Also, they still rely on third parties for even their integration with Outlook.

Microsoft managed to kill off any real viable alternative to Internet Explorer.  Hold on, I know you are thinking \"there's Mozilla, iCab, Opera\"  Well think about it this way, think of all the improvements that could have been made to Netscape if they had been able to charge for their software.  Think of the innovations we might have seen had they been able to sink a huge, revenue based, R &amp; D effort behind their browser.  Well here we are in 2001, and the browser hasn't really moved very far from 1998-9.  This is Microsoft's fault, and we need our government to step up to the plate here and not cave and settle.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "Over the weekend and throughout this week, <a href=\"http://www.imagefv.org/\">The Atlanta Film and Video Festival</a> is being held here in Atlanta.  It offers some movies that have only been shown at SXSW and Sundance.  So far, I have gone to see three movies, and all of them were really solid.  \n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.scratchmovie.com/\">Scratch</a>, which is a history of turntablism, was the best of the three in my opinion, and it did a really solid job of covering this one angle of the hip hop community.  The history of the art of scratching and DJing in general was really solid.  All of my favorite  DJ's like QBert, Mixmaster Mike, and Cut Chemist were featured in the movie, and DJ Faust and DJ Shortee were actually at the showing.  If you have any interest in this sort of thing, and an opportunity to see this movie, go see it.\n</p>\n<p>\nNext, we went to see <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/TUrls?OFF+0245806\">Burning Man: The Burning Sensation</a>.  Since I haven't been to Burning Man yet, it's hard for me to judge how well this film captures the spirit of Burning Man.  The film did contain some very interesting art pieces and happenings at Burning Man, and there was excellent discussion with the film's director afterwards.  \n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, I went to see Revolution OS, a documentary about the Free Software movement and Linux.  While I think this film did a great job of capturing the personalities of people like Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman, I did not think that all of the people that they chose to focus on would have been my first choices.  I would have liked to have seen some mention of PERL, and more coverage of Apache in the movie because I think that these two things, more than any other, have contributed to the success of Linux as an operating system.  I also would have liked to have seen more coverage of individual distributions rather than the focus on a VA Linux, a hardware vendor.  Finally, I think that this documentary went out of its way to position Microsoft as the evil empire.  I would rather have been provided with the raw data and then been able to form my own opinion rather than having the situation framed in such a biased manner.  Still, this film was well worth seeing no matter how much or little you know abotu the Free Software Movement.  Oddly, I was unable to find a live Web site for this movie.</p>\n",

They have the added burden of making up a new world as a stage for their story.  If you have never done it, try the exercise of trying to think one up for yourself.  It's challenging to come up with something original and compelling.\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, I've made a lot of headway over the last year in terms of the whole exercise routine.  It's become a regular part of my life now, making it much easier to maintain.  Now some stats, I started out weighing around 230-235.  Today, I weigh 185, and my waist is 8 inches smaller than it was before.  None of my clothes from a year ago fit me now.  To be honest, I've weighed 185 since January, and in the months since then, I've been lowering my body fat at an average of 1.5% a month.  It feels good, and once you get going, it gets a lot easier.  Now if I could just stop being such an idiot all the time....</p>\n",

I did get to read a pretty good book on this trip named <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553573403/ref=pd_ir_b/107-9094962-6996562\">The Game of Thrones</a>.  Anyone who enjoyed the Robert Jordan books will surely enjoy this book.  I'm reading the second book now, and it seems just as good.  An interesting mix of politics, culture, and sword play.\n",

The doctor took some X-Rays, and informed me that I had something in one of my lungs.  I would have to get a CAT scan of my chest to see what it was.  God I was scared.  I was a smoker, I worked for an environmental engineering company that oversaw asbestos removal projects for a year, it could be anything the doctor said, it could be scar tissue, it could be a shadow in the xray, he didn't mention the other thing it could be because he didn't have to.  I had to wait a whole week for the appointment.  One of the longest weeks of my life.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey put me in this machine and ran this solution through my body that made me fell warm all over.  it was over in about fifteen minutes, then I had to wait two days for the results.  Two very long days.  Finally, the doctor told me that it was nothing, a shadow in the xray perhaps.  If you smoke cigarettes, think for a minute about what could happen to you as a result.</p>\n",

In fact, it's faster than the Dell Pentium II machine I have on my desk at the office running Windows 98.  I've waited a long time to have a single machine that ran every operating system fast enough, and that time has finally come.

Time to reach into the closet and pull out all of the winter clothes to put them away until next year.

Today is really the first time I've had a chance to check out any games. Go UCONN!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I guess I have my own sort of march madness too. Some comments made at the Weblogs panel at SXSW have opened up a flood of emotions and the floodgates of self expression too. It was an unintentional aside too. A reference to something someone had written previously that was simply being used as an example in an answer to a question.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I find myself reading and writing far more than I have in years over the last few days. I feel this incredible need to create things and to digest things that others have labored to create. To redesign all of the crappy Web interfaces I have created.

Where has this energy been hiding for the last year?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's not all good, the emotions that were tapped were really painful for me at first. It was like someone had punched me in the gut. It was a moment when I realized my isolation from those around me, that it was self imposed, and that I could choose to cut it loose. I have a feeling that this happens to a lot of people my age. You reach a point when it's suddenly much harder to form close friendships with others. Not in a social sense necessarily, but emotionally. I'm not sure if it's the ability to trust others becomes more difficult, or that, as you become more set in your ways, it becomes near impossible to find others you can connect with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The bottom line is that I realized that I rarely was expressing my inner stuff.

If you are even remotely a geek, you should read this book. If you aren't a geek, and want to even remotely understand geeks, you should read this book. I'm sure I'll be reading it again. One thing that I thought of when I sat down to type this up is the fact that a great opportunity was missed. Katz could have chosen to couple an Internet site with the book where geeks could meet and discuss what being a geek is all about. I know we have Slashdot and other places, but the emotions evoked by this book are powerful enough to stimulate a powerful discussion and there should be a place to conduct it.

A little background: in 1997 I quit smoking after almost eight years. I succeeded and remained smoke free until 1999 when I broke down slowly. I made the mistake of thinking I could have the occasional cigarette without breaking. I then slowly spiraled back into the life of a smoker. I put the patch on this morning(I started with the 21 mg version.), and the first thing that happens is a really itchey feeling where you put it on. Now I'm feeling a little spacey, probably because it's more nicotine than my body is used to. I'm not craving a butt now, but I will as the day goes on. It's a wrenching feeling as your body craves the substance it's addicted to. What the patch does is allow you to seperate the two different aspects of the addiction and break each down as a unique battle. I'll keep you informed of my progress. Feel free to¬†<a>encourage me</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Both provide a Web based editorial environment from which to update your site. Both allow you to do this within an HTML framework of your own choosing. Blogger allows you to edit and upload regardless of where you are and where your site is hosted. Manila, today, is strictly limited to editing pages that are on a Manila server, but you can do that from any Web connection just like Blogger. I&rsquo;m sure that Userland plans to add the ability to use Manila to update sites served on non-Manila servers from static HTML, or even possibly other types of dynamically served environments. Both editing environments are compelling, but Manila&rsquo;s supports as many pages as you create, where Blogger is focused primarily on pages that contain Weblog entries. This ends up meaning that Manila has much wider reaching applications and can be used for every page of a site rather than just the actual Welog page. The entry interface on blogger is seperate from the actual page of content you are posting(see screen shot above.), and I think that it makes it a more friendly interface for the daily entries that it is focused on.

Manila provides the same functionality, assuming that you have the search engine turned on and indexing your site. Blogger also allows you to preview and then edit your posting before actually publishing it to the site. I would like to see more customization of the editorial environment in both apps.

If you have an existing Weblog type site and already have a hosting environment and space, you&rsquo;re better off using Blogger. It will take far less reworking to get things up and running, and you won&rsquo;t have to sacrifice any other server side stuff you currently use such as PERL, Cold Fusion etc.. If you don&rsquo;t have these things, the space on Userland&rsquo;s Manila server offers you a chance to set things up from scratch and benefit from Userland&rsquo;s ongoing improvement of their offering. If you have your own server box, you can buy Frontier and set up your own Manila framework for your self and others.(I have a retired desktop machine serving 9 sites) It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that Userland has been improving their software on an almost daily basis.

I like both environment&rsquo;s, but I have more content on my site than just the Weblog entries, and I have some plans to add to that content so I like the fact that Manila offers me the full site editing functionality.

Bump has been hosted by Mindspring since before I even had the domain name, and the hosting includes mail and dns. In order for me to move Bump to Manila, I&rsquo;ll either have to bite the bullet and build that stuff for my Manila server or continue to pay Mindspring for the space without actually using it. Another issue that I haven&rsquo;t touched on are my legacy Weblog entries. There is no easy way to move the two years of entries that I already have into either system&rsquo;s framework.

If they don't settle, they will drag whatever verdict they get through a series of appeals until they get closer to what they think is reasonable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've been using the new¬†<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macos/\">Mac OS 9¬†</a>for a few weeks now, and I'm pretty happy with it.

These people look down their noses at people who aren't Mac OS/Windows/Linux users. Why am I fed up? Well, I use all three, and I see each as a tool that can be used in a different way(for me.)

How do you know you are using the right tool for the job? What about the alternate platforms? The BeOSes and Amiga's of the world?

It's a pleasure to use, the keyboard has a nice tactile feel to it and the display is bright. The screen isn't as small feeling as I thought it would be. I had forgotten how much easier to use Apple's laptops are in multiple locations than Windows 9x laptops are. The Location Manager makes transitions between work and home much easier for me than on my Gateway. The iBook is a little heavier than I thought it would be, and the speaker is weak, but these are the only two complaints I have so far. It's faster than I thought it would be, and the battery life seems to be close to five hours(although Apple advertises 6 hours).

I would say about half the audience(and about half the group of people I went with) liked it and the other half didn't care for it as much. I really liked it, and fell into it. As a result, it scared the shit out of me. It's very psychological, and if you let it get ahold of you, you're in for an interesting ride. I would recommend it highly, but I don't think everyone gets into these kinds of thrillers. I got a little seasick from the documentary style footage, but I think it added the right effect to the movie. In interviews I have seen with the people who made the movie, they referred to the Seventies television show \"In Search Of...\" I saw this influence throughout the movie. They leave a lot up to your imagination, and that's what gets you. It allows you to imagine the worst scenario, the one that scares you the most.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing that is worth noting is that the Web site takes on a different role than the typical Hollywood movie site. It adds to the mythos they built in the movie, providing more background, facts, and details than the movie could. It also contains audio of interviews that didn't make it into the movie in their entirety. I like this, I got home and began crawling through all this additional material.(While looking over my shoulder.) It seems like they are adding stuff all the time. I would hold off on the site until you have seen the movie.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vcnet.com/hide/download/icons.html\">More iBook icons¬†</a>, these are from Hide who is another of my favorite icon authors.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

It looks like a strong product, perfect for a company like mine that is looking for strong customizable content management that works with a variety of existing database systems, LDAP directories, and other enterprise wide applications. Seems like this framework will be a good jumping off point for CF developers who want the basic functions it provides but are capable of extending it beyond that to suit their companies needs. This product will turn up the heat in this area quite a bit(plus it has features out of the box that other content management systems don't have.) and it is pretty cheap at $7500.00 a server. They are also trying to meet the needs of Business people that need things like realtime data reports that are customized.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Webcasts are a great resource. I like being to gather this industry knowledge from my office. I just wish that they worked better. With all of the congestion on the net, it dropped out of me about 50 times. (Despite the fact that I have 100 baseT access to a t-1) Seems like the reporting functionality of the product will be a huge selling point with our Business and Sales types.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Things at my office are changing really rapidly now. I'm having a hard time keeping a grip on it all. We really have launched ourselves as an Internet business unit so the next few months should be trying and interesting. I am having somewhat of a tough time dealing with non-technical folks being involved in our Internet business. It seems like this happens a lot in our business: one person spends a ton of time architecting a strategy and building a worhtwhile product, then a normal suit type comes along and gets to take credit for the profits from that hard work. In the meantime they manage to muck up the strategy so longer term accomplishments are watered down and more difficult. I've seen this happen over and over again, so I'm fighting it tooth and nail.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

My biggest beefs with it now are that it doesn't really do CD Audio the way I want it to. SoundJam will automatically download CD information over the net and it supports encoding, which MacAMP does not. Of course, MacAMP 1.0 is not a finished product and I am interested to see how it progresses. I think that SoundJam will also be worked on quite diligently over the next few months considering the competition and all of the industry focus on MP3.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them if you¬†<a>email me</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, installation did not go smoothly. After about half an hour of installation had gone by, I got an exception error and the installer locked itself up. I tried a variety of things over the next two hours, and I eventually figured out that the installer was choking on a java .dll. After I deleted the .dll, installation proceeded without incident. I'll try to cover all of the applications at some point this week. So far, I have used Word and Outlook only.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Outlook</strong>: I use Outlook as my primary Windows email program. This is primarily because we use an Exchange server at the office and it makes managing that mail and my Internet email easier. I also sync my PalmPilot with it. Outlook 2000 is not substantially different from Outlook 98 on the surface. My settings and email migrated without issue. I added some contacts, appointments, and to do list items and then synched my Palm V. Everything worked as I would normally expect it to. The Outlook Today panel is more customizable, and it seems like everything is HTML based so creating custom interfaces for it should be quite easy. The main Outlook window also can act as a Web browser.(Not that I would ever use it as one). The enhancements to Outlook don't amount to much on a single user level.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Word:</strong>¬†The application, as with Outlook, does not stray from 97 all that much. I was much more interested in looking at a document after it had been saved with the \"Save as Web Page\" command than basic operation, which I expect is very much the same as 97. I saved two documents that I had lying around and opened them with Allaire Homesite 4.0. While the HTML is more correct and less intrusive than the 97/98 converter, there are a lot of custom tags that aren't part of any spec. They have a modified version of CSS that they use too. Overall, I think it's better than the same feature in Word 97. I would, however, rather have had something that output strict HTML 4.0 or at least had that as an option. The document also contains meta-tags that a novice user might not be aware of. These give the users name, date of edit, and other information about the document. There is a copy of one document I saved this way¬†<a href=\"http://radio-weblogs.com/0100237/1999/06/ancil/orientationnotes.htm\">here¬†</a>for your perusal. I tried out its self repairing option, which worked well, and also tried to use an option I hadn't installed. Word then prompted me and asked if I would like to install the option(in this case a file format filter) and installed it at my command. I liked this quite a bit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Feedback:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I liked what I saw, but I am not certain that the average Office user will benefit substantially from this update. Most of the changes are of benefit to large scale users. Considering the update costs, I don't think anyone who doesn't need the new features for some reason should run out and buy the upgrade.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Allaire has updated HomeSite 4 to 4.01.

The first two sessions were essentially marketing information aimed at IT decision makers and support staff. These were followed by an hour long session by Steve Ballmer. Interesting stuff.

The file formats of the new Office are binary compatible with Office 97/98, but you sacrifice many of the coolest features in doing so. The new file format is well formed XML(that's at least what I was told at the session), and the HTML capabilites looked really good. They incorporated a lot of Web based functionality through Active X controls. For instance, someone can view a Powerpoint presentation you save this way over the Internet using IE 5.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Steve Ballmer talked about where they want to end up and how this release of Office is the first step in the directions they want to go. He talked about the changing face of the devices we use to access networked information, and how they were trying to create a perfect environment for the onscreen consumption of information.

I installed it on my 9600/350 at home. Since this is an unsupported configuration, I had to bypass this part of the installer to get it to install. It, however, installed without issue.(I installed it on an external SCSI drive) After the lengthy install process(the machine reboots three times during the install), it booted without issue. It is very NeXtish, and those of you who have experience with that interface will find this one very easy to pick up. For the Mac User looking to learn it, it might be a bit intimidating at first. There are some of the Mac OS interface elements, but things don't work like a Mac OS machine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The OS is very repsonsive. I played with it for quite a while on it's own. Getting Apache configured was very simple, and I had it serving Web pages for me within minutes. The OS doesn't currently support serial ports, so in order to get access to the Internet via a modem you have set another machine up as a router. The Mac OS app that is included comes with a basic 8.5.1 install, and seemed very stable and compatible. It felt as fast as running the Mac OS directly on the machine. I ran several applications(Frontier, Fireworks 2, BBEdit, and Netscape) and everything worked the way I expected it to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The command line interface was exactly what you would expect from any UNIX operating system.

One of my goals is to get back to daily updates this week, so here goes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/\">Episode One¬†</a>hype is at its height this week. I am trying to ignore it, and at times embrace it. Lots of negative reviews(Time, Newsweek) and some positive ones. Does it really matter? Will it stop people from going to see the movie?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think that this movie is insulated from this.

I have too many unused domain names as it is.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I went to the Apple WWDC satellite broadcast here in Atlanta. I am happy that they seem to be delivering on what they promised one year ago. It's refreshing because they were changing direction once a year.¬†<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index.html\">The new Powerbooks¬†</a>look nice, and I am going to try and budget myself so that I can get one. I wasn't too excited by the Sonata demo, but they are building in features(albeit more elegantly) that have existed in the Windows world for a long time. Sherlock II and Quicktime 4 reveal clues as to what the interface elements for Mac OS X will be.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>CamWorld's latest rant is about¬†Weblogs¬†. Cameron has really good perspective. To do this right, I would have to devote more time to it than I can. Will this stop me from doing it as much as I can? Absolutely not, I enjoy doing it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Web Review goes¬†<a href=\"http://webreview.com/wr/pub/1999/05/07/feature/index.html\">more into depth¬†</a>on the engine that the PlayStation II will run on. Without a doubt, this machine is designed to be far more than a traditional console gaming unit. I'm happy that they are building support for the first unit's games into the new one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm loving the new¬†<a href=\"http://www.bugjuice.com/bethorton/\">Beth Orton CD¬†</a>.

Some great stuff, and I find myself wishing that I had more time to dedicate to a single site rather than having to split my time and effort across so many markets. It's tough to keep everything straight and to keep up with everything.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've gotten to see some really dynamic speakers, and to see people like Jakob Nielson, whose work I have followed quite diligently over the Web, speak first hand. His talk was excellent, and drove home and validated the way I feel about site design. I'll definitely be working on the two projects that I am doing personally slightly differently as a result.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also got a chance to go to lunch with a group of Frontier users who were attending the conference. I really enjoyed this \"session\" quite a bit, and it was nice to put faces with some names.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the meantime, with the fade out from my death march at work combined with my attendance at this conference have conspired against regular Bump updates. I promise that this isn't a trend that will continue, and with the projects that I have planned for the next two months, I'm sure to have an active mind and site in the coming months.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So that's it for now, I hope to get things straight here in short order. A careful study of this site's usage statistics shows that nearly everyone is running a 4.0 browser, and I think I am going to start implementing some more complex things here to speed up load times and provide better navigation. Any feedback you might have would be very helpful to me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I have office email, Internet email, and I access both at home and at the office. In each place, I have both a PC and a Macintosh(Each running more than one operating system.), as well as a Pilot that I read mail from. I have to turn cartwheels to make sure I don't delete mail I need. Inevitably, its 10 pm, and I need something that is a 20 minute drive away. So I'm looking for a solution that doesn't involve my carrying equipment around with me everywhere I go. Web based email would be the answer, I guess, but I think that there has to be a more elegant way. Also, I prefer to be able to read and compose email offline. I also like to read my sent mail and refer to it. This has become an issue for me, and I haven't found an acceptable answer yet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I did, however, find some useful things on my quest for an answer.

I am using it now to transfer documents from the office to my home. I wouldn't use the free email, if I wanted that there are a million other places, but I like the idea and interface.

It also would be great for traveling types.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"http://radio-weblogs.com/0100237/1999/02/www.hotoffice.com\">HotOffice¬†</a>takes this idea one step further.(You also have to pay for it.) For a small business with high speed Internet access, this is a quick and inexpensive Intranet with all the expected features and a much lower cost. I wonder how many users you have to have before you hit the cost barrier of doing the Intranet in house? Great solution for a small company with a distributed workforce. Unfortunately, they seem to only support some WIN32 browsers, no Macintosh browsers. Doesn't that sort of defeat the purpose?

I didn't invent something new or finish a gigantic project, nor was I visited by some higher power. I took two pieces of information that previously resided in my head and connected them. They were both there for weeks, waiting to be moved close enough together to interact, and when they did, I had a moment of clarity. Frontier 5, the best dual platform web content management system, has been available for both Macintosh and 32 bit Windows OS`s for a couple of weeks now. While Frontier 5 was in development, I avoided it. Beta's were posted, but I didn't download them. No time to play with beta software. I stepped up to the plate this week. Working diligently this weekend, I have begun the task of bringing Bump into the Frontier enviroment. It`s gonna be great when it is done.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On Friday, I got a new Windows NT tower on my desk at work. For the first time ever in my life, I have the opportunity to work with Windows and Macintosh computers in the same ability range. Its eye opening to see what NT does better than the Mac and vice versa. (That is a subject for another essay.) Suddenly, I am checking my checkbook to see if I can afford the same setup at home.(I can't) For the first time in my desktop computing life, there is no longer an other side of the fence. I see things as they are.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My web server (I am the administrator as well as the content builder) is also a Windows NT box. I have dedicated a ton of time over the last two months porting our interactive content and moving it from an out-of-house UNIX box to the NT box. In the process, I learned ColdFusion and its markup language, CFML. Frontier previously existed in my mind as a client side only tool. Suddenly, on Friday, I put together the fact that it is capable of many of the server side cartwheels I need it for too. Simple connection, but it blew my mind that I had previously missed it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",
